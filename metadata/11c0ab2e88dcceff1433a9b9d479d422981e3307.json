Khoury (CRC, 2015).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 978-1-4822-3057-4\r\n\r\nThe latest edition of a perennial bestseller, Multistage Separation Processes, Fourth Edition provides a clear and thorough presentation of the theoretical foundation, and understanding of the development, evaluation, design, and optimization steps of these processes, from both an academic and industrial perspective. The bookâ€™s emphasis on starting with theoretical models and their role in computer simulation, followed by practical applications, sets it apart from other texts on this topic. The author also highlights the importance of relating fundamental concepts to intuitive understanding of the processes.\r\n\r\nSee Whatâ€™s New in the Fourth Edition:\r\n\r\nChapter on fluid-solid operations\r\nExpanded development of theories and methods for many applications\r\nAdds numerous industry-related examples and end-of-chapter problems\r\nCase studies combined with examples\r\nUpdated and enhanced figures\r\n\r\nThe book includes a generous number of examples from a wide variety of applications to relate theory to actual results, and to demonstrate the performance of process under varying conditions. The chapter topics follow a logical path that starts with basics and theoretical concepts, and progresses systematically into the various separation processes. Each chapter provides the information relevant to a specific topic, and refers to appropriate chapters in the book as needed. These features combine to give you the understanding required to make the best selections of property prediction and simulation techniques and avoid the cost incurred by the use of improper simulations","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:11c0ab2e88dcceff1433a9b9d479d422981e3307","amp;dn":"Multistage+Separation+Processes+4th+ed+-+Fouad+M.+Khoury","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"11c0ab2e88dcceff1433a9b9d479d422981e3307","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,192,171,46,136,220,206,255,20,51,169,185,212,121,212,34,152,30,51,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
