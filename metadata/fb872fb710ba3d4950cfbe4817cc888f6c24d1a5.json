This simulation covers the entire Circle Line in its current operational service which includes the new section to Hammersmith. This line offers a length of 27km with 35 stations.\n\nUnlike previous games, in this volume the player has a visible character in 3rd person mode but the majority of the game is still played in first person mode. Also unlike previous versions no exterior camera is included and the player can board and travel on trains not controlled by the player. The Circle Line service of the London Underground runs through the city of London and stops at 35 stations. Since 2010 the extension to &quot;Hammersmith&quot; is included in the Circle Line service. The Circle Line drives in two directions: &quot;Inner Rail&quot; (anti-clockwise, Edgware Road - Hammersmith) and &quot;Outer Rail&quot; (clockwise, Hammersmith - Edgware Road) There is 54 km of drivable track both above and below ground.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb872fb710ba3d4950cfbe4817cc888f6c24d1a5","amp;dn":"World+Of+Subways+Vol.3+London+Under+Ground","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb872fb710ba3d4950cfbe4817cc888f6c24d1a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,135,47,183,16,186,61,73,80,207,190,72,23,204,136,143,108,36,209,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
