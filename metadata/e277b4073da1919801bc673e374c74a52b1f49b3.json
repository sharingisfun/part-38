As a result, she has earned multiple Grammy Awards, two Academy of Country Music awards, an Emmy Award, an ALMA Award, numerous United States and internationally certified gold, platinum and multiplatinum albums, in addition to Tony Award and Golden Globe nominations. A singer-songwriter and record producer, she is recognized as a definitive interpreter of songs. Being one of musicÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most versatile, and commercially successful female singers, she was for a time the &quot;highest paid woman in rock.&quot; In total, she has released over 30 solo albums, more than 15 compilations or greatest hits albums, and has collaborated with various artists on over 120 other albums. She also has charted 38 Billboard Hot 100 singles, 21 of which have reached the top 40, 10 of which have reached the top 10, three peaking at No. 2, and the No. 1 hit, &quot;You're No Good.&quot;\n\nIn late 1977 Ronstadt surpassed the success of Heart Like A Wheel with her album Simple Dreams, which held the No. 1 position for five consecutive weeks on the Billboard Album Chart. The album has been certified triple platinum (over 3 million US copies sold). The album was released in September 1977, and by December, it had replaced Fleetwood Mac's long running No. 1 album Rumours in the top spot. Simple Dreams spawned hit singles on both the pop and country singles charts as well. It included the RIAA platinum-certified single &quot;Blue Bayou&quot; - a Country Rock interpretation of a Roy Orbison written song - as well as &quot;It's So Easy&quot; previously sung by Buddy Holly - and &quot;Poor Poor Pitiful Me&quot; a song written for the album, by Warren Zevon, an up and coming songwriter of the time whom Ronstadt elected to highlight and record. The album, garnered several Grammy Award nominations - including Record Of The Year and Best Pop Vocal Performance, Female for &quot;Blue Bayou&quot; - and won its art director, Kosh a Grammy Award for Best Album Cover, the first of three Grammy Awards he would win for designing Ronstadt album covers.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e277b4073da1919801bc673e374c74a52b1f49b3","amp;dn":"Linda+Ronstadt+-+It%5C%27s+So+Easy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e277b4073da1919801bc673e374c74a52b1f49b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,119,180,7,61,161,145,152,1,188,103,62,55,76,116,165,43,31,73,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
