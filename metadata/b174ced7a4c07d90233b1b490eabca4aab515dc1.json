Unfortunately, the tinny analog sound Ã¢â‚¬â€œ obviously intended to lend a 1950s air to the proceedings - detracts somewhat from the music. Still, the production is not so bad that blues fans should ignore this album.\n\nCostello first gained attention as the hot lead guitarist in Susan TedeschiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s band. He played on TedeschiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s smash album Just WonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Burn when he was just 18. CuttinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ In is actually CostelloÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s second solo release, and the music here is so good I may have to track down his first album. Costello comes across as a well-rounded artist. He sings with emotional intensity, his guitar work is fiery, and his songwriting shows great promise. It's enough to make you forget about Kenny Wayne Shepherd and Jonny Lang.\n\nThe album includes some Chicago chestnuts (Willie DixonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s &quot;I Want to Be Loved&quot; and Otis RushÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s &quot;Double Trouble&quot;), a few choice obscurities (including Junior WatsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s &quot;CuttinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ In&quot;), as well as three Costello originals. The Chicago tunes bring to mind Muddy WatersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ hard-rocking Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ70s band with Pinetop Perkins, Johnny Winter and Bob Margolin, while the R&amp;B tunes are faithful to the Ace Records sound. CostelloÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s original compositions reflect his knowledge of both blues and jump. In fact, this whole package is righteously raucous.\n\nGranted, the covers donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t deviate much from the original versions, but theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re played with passion and skill, particularly J. B. LenoirÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s boisterous &quot;Talk to Your Daughter,&quot; Earl KingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s soulful classic &quot;Those Lonely, Lonely Nights,&quot; and a neat version of Blind BlakeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unusual calypso tune &quot;Goombay Rock.&quot;\n\nWhat CuttinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ In lacks in originality it makes up for with diversity, chops and enthusiasm. Given his fresh-faced good looks and precocious abilities, Sean Costello could be well on his way to blues superstardom.\n\nRecord Label: Landslide Records","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b174ced7a4c07d90233b1b490eabca4aab515dc1","amp;dn":"Sean+Costello+-+Cuttin%27+In","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b174ced7a4c07d90233b1b490eabca4aab515dc1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,116,206,215,164,192,125,144,35,59,27,73,14,171,202,74,171,81,93,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
