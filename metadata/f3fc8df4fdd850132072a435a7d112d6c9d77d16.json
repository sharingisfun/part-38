I have asked those who are torrenting the official one to add TPB trackers.\n\nOfficial tracker: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.linuxformat.co.uk:6969/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.linuxformat.co.uk:6969/announce&lt;/a&gt;\n\n(add it too)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f3fc8df4fdd850132072a435a7d112d6c9d77d16","amp;dn":"Linux+Format+Issue+116+-+KDE+Issue","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f3fc8df4fdd850132072a435a7d112d6c9d77d16","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,252,141,244,253,216,80,19,32,114,164,53,167,209,18,214,201,215,125,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
