Could it really threaten civilization? \nHow much money are we willing to spend on alternate fuels? Should we \nuse technologies that involve other risks (like nuclear power)? \n\nProfessor and physicist Richard Wolfson's course will allow you to form \nanswers to those questionsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½answers that are grounded in scientific facts. \nYou do not need a background in science to understand these issues as \nhe presents them. \n\nUsing simple diagrams and graphics, Professor Wolfson makes his subject \nboth lively and accessible as he explains how the Earth's climate regulates \ntemperature, how human activity can unbalance this system, how scientists \npredict the extent and impact of global warming, and what we can do \nabout it. \n\nThis course examines human energy use and global warming and offers \na basic literacy in the science of climate.\n\nCourse Lecture Titles\n \n- Keeping Warm \n- A Tale of Three Planets \n- Climates Past, Climates Future \n- Computing the Climate \n- EnergyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Cheap and Plentiful \n- EnergyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½What It Does, Where It's From \n- Fossil Fuels \n- Nuclear Options \n- Renewable Energy \n- Energy EfficiencyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½More from Less","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:760ae122fa262024d95443aa2284039adbf23d75","amp;dn":"TTC+Energy+and+Climate+-+Science+for+Citizens+in+the+Age+of+Glob","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"760ae122fa262024d95443aa2284039adbf23d75","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,10,225,34,250,38,32,36,217,84,67,170,34,132,3,154,219,242,61,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
