Formed at the University of Vermont in 1983 (with the current line up solidifying in 1985), the band's four membersÃ¢â‚¬â€Trey Anastasio (guitars, lead vocals), Mike Gordon (bass, vocals), Jon Fishman (drums, percussion, vocals), and Page McConnell (keyboards, vocals)Ã¢â‚¬â€performed together for over 20 years before going on hiatus in August 2004. They reunited March 2009 for Phish in Hampton, a series of three consecutive concerts played in the Hampton Coliseum in Hampton, Virginia, and have since resumed performing regularly.\n\nPhish's music blends elements of a wide variety of genres,[2] including rock, jazz, progressive rock, psychedelic rock, hard rock, funk, folk, bluegrass, and blues. Due to the band's improvisational style, their concerts are original in terms of the order and selection of songs and the way each song and set are performed.\n\nAlthough the band has received little radio play or mainstream exposure, Phish has developed a large and dedicated following, known as Phans, by word of mouth, the exchange of live recordings, and selling over 8 million albums and DVDs in the United States. Rolling Stone stated that the band helped to &quot;...spawn a new wave of bands oriented around group improvisation and super-extended grooves&quot;. They remain a very popular and successful touring act.\n\n\nOrigin\nBurlington, Vermont, United States \n\nGenres\nRock, jam rock, alternative rock, jazz-rock, neo-psychedelia, progressive rock,[1] folk rock, funk rock, bluegrass \n\nYears active\n1983Ã¢â‚¬â€œpresent\nBreak: 2004Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2008 \n\nLabels\nElektra, Rhino/WMG, JEMP, MapleMusic Recordings (Canada) \n\nAssociated acts\nPhil Lesh and Friends, Oysterhead, 70 Volt Parade, Amfibian, Benevento/Russo Duo, Jazz Mandolin Project, Pork Tornado, Les Claypool, Ramble Dove, Rhythm Devils, SerialPod, Surrender to the Air, Trey Anastasio, Trey Anastasio Band, Vida Blue, The Grateful Dead \n\nWebsite\nwww.phish.com \n\n\n\nMembers\nTrey Anastasio\nJon Fishman\nMike Gordon\nPage McConnell \n\n\n\nPast members\nJeff Holdsworth\nMarc Daubert \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9479befe7754465c2d20e02bd65cef47fd575df7","amp;dn":"Phish+Studio+Discography+%281988-2004%29+Flac","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9479befe7754465c2d20e02bd65cef47fd575df7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,121,190,254,119,84,70,92,45,32,224,43,214,92,239,71,253,87,93,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
