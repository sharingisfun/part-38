Composed even as German troops assaulted the city, this piece is considered one of the most powerful of the 20th century.\n\nThis rip is from the RCO Live Hybrid SACD 06002. It is taken from the standard stereo Red Book (CDDA) layer, not the 5.0 surround SACD layer. The audio was recorded from live performances at the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam on 19 and 20 January, 2006. So, understandably, there is some faint audience noise present, in addition to a few seconds of applause at the end of the fourth movement.\n\nThe files are encoded using the Apple Lossless codec, in .m4a containers.
