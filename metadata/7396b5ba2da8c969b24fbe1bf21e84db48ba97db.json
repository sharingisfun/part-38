LOL!\n\nWill upload further recordings taken that would be helpful for people to get a feel of the course!\n\nThere is a group and individual project for name sake but I have not uploaded that folder because I am a ethical pirate LOL..!!\n\n\nIf you require more information and advice on intellectual property in UK send me email or pm or comment me.\n\n\nAs for students who want to take up this course from abroad and other places outside the UK, Unless you have very high academic qualifications or experience, please dont bother wasting your time and money for this.\n\nAll biological and chemistry based subjects have the least chance of getting a job wheras the electronics as of july 2012 seems to be blooming for some reason. Even getting a support role is crazy in this field.\n\nAnd seems there is a 99% majority English people in these fields which questions their racial and equality based &quot;diversification&quot;.
