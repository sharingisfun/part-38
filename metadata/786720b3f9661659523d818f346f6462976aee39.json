A bit shaky at times and there are plenty of hands and heads going in and out of view in the beginning but picture quality is OK.\n\nBonus disc:  \nA CNN exclusive: Poppy Harlow goes inside the world of KISS ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the band and the brand. From coffins to comic books to condoms, KISS has licensed about 3,000 pieces of merchandise, more than any other band. Harlow interviews Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley at their homes in Los Angeles, talks to the entire band at their studio, then accompanies KISS to Oshkosh, Wisconsin for a rock concert before nearly 30,000 fans. This is KISS like youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve never seen before.\n\nSetlist:\nDeuce\nLove gun\nCold gin\nCalling Dr. Love\nFirehouse\nShock me\nAce's solo\ngene's solo\n100,000 years\nDetroit rock city\nBlack diamond\nRock and roll all nite\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:786720b3f9661659523d818f346f6462976aee39","amp;dn":"Kiss+-+Laguna+Hills%2C+California+1996-06-15+%28audience+version%29+DV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"786720b3f9661659523d818f346f6462976aee39","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,103,32,179,249,102,22,89,82,61,129,143,52,111,100,98,151,106,238,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
