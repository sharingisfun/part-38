This is that book. Personal Footprint socks are worked 100% in the round (no back and forth on heels), no stitches need picking up, toe and heel are replaceable, there is no arithmetic, the surface is fully available for designs, the socks are easily worked two-at-a-time, and the knitter creates a very compact, portable sock pattern that can fit in any little sock bag for portability.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9da60cd615157d831243c3b8e6c19f8730f2739a","amp;dn":"Personal+Footprints+for+Insouciant+Sock+Knitters","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9da60cd615157d831243c3b8e6c19f8730f2739a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,166,12,214,21,21,125,131,18,67,195,184,230,193,159,135,48,242,115,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
