Romney made many strong arguments,\n but rapped out singles when he could have hit home runs. The problem is that heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a Ã¢â‚¬Å“tree personÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and \n not a Ã¢â‚¬Å“forest personÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ as Dennis likes to put it; that is, Romney focuses on specific problems \n often at the expense of the big picture.\n\n\n\nPrager 20121017     1 Debate Two\n\nPrager H1: Dennis was frustrated by the format which trivialized the seriousness of the occasion.\n It was overly theatrical, the questions were not interesting and the posturing by both candidates\n not dignifiedÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ \n Candy Crowley injected herself into the debate in completely inappropriate ways, especially on the Benghazi\n issue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                  Download, seed, and spread the word. \n\n\nMore Stuff is here\nRush, Michael Savage, Mark Levin, Dennis Prager\nthepiratebay . se / user / CAPTAIN7SS/0/3\nbeta . demonoid . me / files / ?seeded=2&amp;uid=7492662\n\nRush Shows and Neal Boortz Shows Live are here\nthepiratebay . se / user / amuck5 /\n\nLaura Ingraham is here\nthepiratebay . se / user / freedomczar /\n\nGlenn Beck Insider is here\nthepiratebay . se / search / glenn%20beck/0/99/100\n\nPodcasts of the Rush Limbaugh Show are here (temporarily stopped uploading)\nthepiratebay . se / user / Annoyme /\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:99c83a447f8a82353c23901f3dec5097f2bcb9e3","amp;dn":"The+Dennis+Prager+Radio+Show+OCT-17-2012+WED","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"99c83a447f8a82353c23901f3dec5097f2bcb9e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,200,58,68,127,138,130,53,60,35,144,31,61,236,80,151,242,188,185,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
