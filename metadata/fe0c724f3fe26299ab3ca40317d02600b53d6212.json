These newer, better scans are from various Team-DCP scanners (including AvalonSCC and TenChiefs) and there are no ads in this release. Also, I have added the Titans East one-shot special (also DCP) that starts off this whole series. I will leave my previous torrent up but this is the definite version of the Winnick run until a digital copy is made, so I suggest you upgrade for a smoother and more coherent reading experience. Sorry about the previous torrent, thanks to all the DCP scanners for these awesome prints and as always, please seed and enjoy! :-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe0c724f3fe26299ab3ca40317d02600b53d6212","amp;dn":"Titans+v2+01-38+%2B+Ex+%282008-2011%7CFIXED%7Cnoads%7CDCP%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe0c724f3fe26299ab3ca40317d02600b53d6212","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,12,114,79,63,226,98,153,171,60,164,3,23,208,38,0,181,61,98,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
