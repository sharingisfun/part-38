This is where the first seeds of YBC were sown. The two did numerous covers before deciding that original funk rock must be made, and thus the journey to find a drummer and second guitarist began.\n\nVery weary from their travels, the two then stumbled upon a great forest, mysterious yet inviting. Inside they found the greatest centaur drummer in the universe: Sean McGill. As he rolled away magnificent fills using all four hooves and both arms, the omnipotent bassist and squishy merman guitarist knew they had found their rhythm section. A few riffs later and a song was born.\n\nYet the trio knew that they had not found the end of their path. As the centaur joined the group and the creatures grew stronger, they followed their inhuman instincts and looked far and wide for that special potion only accessible from the fires in the middle of the earth. This is where they met outspoken alien and discoverer of the fountain of youth, Craig Adams, to help them in their domination of mankind. After becoming immortal from his discovery, his next challenge was to create music mind-boggling enough to create peace.\n\nWith their powers combined, the four musicians vowed to use their skills only for the good of all; all meaning the band. With mischief and witty jokes in mind, they set off to laugh about trivialities and people who take themselves and their worlds too seriously. So far, they've been successful.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80e9c45b75ba4b823faeeef5d6b714b129d70b7d","amp;dn":"You+Beautiful+Creature","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80e9c45b75ba4b823faeeef5d6b714b129d70b7d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,233,196,91,117,186,75,130,63,174,238,245,214,183,20,177,41,215,11,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
