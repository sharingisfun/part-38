He was key in the transition from jump blues and big-band swing to rhythm and blues and rock and roll.[3]\n\nBartholomew and Domino co-wrote many songs that were hits, including &quot;Ain&amp;#039;t That a Shame&quot;, &quot;I&amp;#039;m in Love Again&quot; &quot;Blue Monday&quot; and &quot;I&amp;#039;m Walkin&amp;#039;&quot;.\n\nHis &quot;I Hear You Knocking&quot; was a hit for Gale Storm in the 50&amp;#039;s, and Dave Edmunds in the 70&amp;#039;s; &quot;One Night&quot; and &quot;Witchcraft&quot; were both hits for Elvis Presley. Pat Boone&amp;#039;s cover of &quot;AinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t That a Shame,&quot; and Rick Nelson&amp;#039;s version of &quot;I&amp;#039;m Walkin&amp;#039;&quot; were top twenty hits in the late &amp;#039;50s and early &amp;#039;60s. Chuck Berry&amp;#039;s only #1 Hot 100 hit was a cover of Bartholomew&amp;#039;s &quot;My Ding-a-Ling&quot;, although Berry substantially changed the arrangement and verses.\n\nBartholomew produced a series of memorable hits such as &quot;Lawdy Miss Clawdy&quot; with Lloyd Price; and &quot;I Hear You Knocking&quot; and &quot;One Night&quot; with Smiley Lewis; plus &quot;Let the Good Times Roll&quot; with Shirley &amp; Lee.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:78dd3d65de1a866cc2f8d29d61fd8b5dbc94dc39","amp;dn":"Dave+Bartholomew","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"78dd3d65de1a866cc2f8d29d61fd8b5dbc94dc39","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,221,61,101,222,26,134,108,194,248,210,157,97,253,139,93,188,148,220,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
