Following on from Volume 1: Best of the KMEL Mixes &amp; Volume 2: Best of the Remixes and Megamixes, Volume 3 reveals, for the first time ever, eighteen of ShadowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s earliest original compositions. NOTHING ON THIS CD HAS EVER BEEN AVAILABLE, ANYWHERE, until now.*\n\nWhile in High School, Shadow saved up and purchased a $300 4-Track cassette recorder. For the next several years, this would be the only method available for Shadow to record, and he made the most of it by committing tons of ideas to tape, several of which eventually saw release: tracks like debut ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLesson 4ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ for Hollywood BASIC, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Legitimate MixÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ for African MCÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Zimbabwe Legit, and part of his Solesides bow ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œEntropyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ were all realized during these pivotal years. Now, for the first time, Shadow has hand-picked some of his favorite moments and compiled them for this EXCLUSIVE DJShadow.com/ ShopDjShadow.com release. (Have we made it clear yet? You canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t get this disc ANYWHERE ELSE.)\n\n\nAmong the highlights:\n- The original ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDJ ShadowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Theme,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ with multiple breaks and cuts colliding for a playful but intricate mission statement.\n- An alternative mixdown of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLesson 4.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n- The follow-up to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLesson 4,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLesson 5ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ which was intended to showcase 45s only (this is 1991 weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re talking about, folks!!).\n- Several beats for early MC collaborators T-Mor and Paris.\n- ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Source Is Serious Business,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ShadowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s entry into a (never released) compilation commissioned by the Source Magazine of all ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œUnsigned HypeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ column winners.\n\nNeed we continue? Volume 3 delivers the most comprehensive glimpse ever into ShadowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s early musical ideas. Shadow reports that many tracks have been lost forever (such as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGangsta Jazz,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ immortalized over the telephone on a Radio Sole skit), and still more have yet to be located. So with Shadow facing forward and gearing up to work on his next album, it is unlikely that there will ever be a more definitive document of his 4-Track era than this.\n\n*(Okay, so ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDJ ShadowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Theme (Original Version)ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ came out on a cassette attached to copies of NME 10 years ago, but cÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢mon. Has anybody ever seen that???)\n\n===================================================================\n\nNo password, Very good quality [VBR up to 320Kbs], Ripped from original, All tagged, Included covers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e4c76dd986bf7b3595b92a057071e0cba296d282","amp;dn":"DJ+Shadow+-+The+4-Track+Era+Vol+3%3A+Best+Of+The+Original+Prod","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e4c76dd986bf7b3595b92a057071e0cba296d282","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,199,109,217,134,191,123,53,149,185,42,5,112,113,224,203,162,150,210,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
