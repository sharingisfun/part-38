If you notice an errors/mistakes, say so in comments. Thank you. And thanks to MrSuicideSheep.\n\n\n\n**I did not include mixes and some preview EP's and added two songs of my own choice (see bellow)**\n\n***Some tracks may or may not be missing because I downloaded each song manually, from start to finish. Generally you should find every track from 2010-2014***\n\n\n\nSongs that I included: \n\n1. Chase &amp; Status - Blind Faith (feat. Liam Bailey).mp3\n2. Strange Talk - Eskimo Boy (Draper Remix).mp3\n\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT: I can seed only about 12 hours a day, so if I'm not online, then I will be back soon.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:90d0ccd875abe60fb23d1bea7e6efb501a6e57a1","amp;dn":"MrSuicideSheep+YouTube+site+rip+%5B+2010-2014+%5D+mp3%40192kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"90d0ccd875abe60fb23d1bea7e6efb501a6e57a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,208,204,216,117,171,230,15,178,61,27,234,126,110,251,80,26,110,87,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
