Secret Layer very slightly tweaks the color of specific pixels. You canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t distinguish the altered photo from the original one.\nAny time you transfer an encrypted file to someone by email, Skype, or another method, anyone on your network can see that youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re transferring something encrypted. But when you hide your data in a image, to everyone else it looks like youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re uploading another photo to the web, just like billions of other people. In other words, your photo can slip away in the crowd, no different from everyone else.\n\nHOW DOES IT WORK?\nSecret Layer very slightly tweaks the color of specific pixels. You can't distinguish the altered photo from the original one: even if a forensics specialist opens the image in a text editor, there's no way they can detect signs of any Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½extraÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ information inside.\n\nENCRYPTION IS NOT ENOUGH\nSure, you can save or send encrypted files out in the open way. Just slap a password on it and send. People do that every day. But every time you send encrypted files, you're taking a risk: you draw attention to the data inside. Prying eyes know that if you have something to encrypt, you have something to hide. It's like putting a massive lock on a suitcase and then leaving it out in the open place Ã¢â‚¬â€ people start wondering what the big fuss is for. And what if the Ã¢â‚¬Å“peopleÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ are hackers or identity thieves?\n\n\nIt's not enough to encrypt your documents. For real protection, you have to hide in plain sight.\nSecret Layer lets you encrypt your data (so you're no worse off than before) and then hide that encrypted data in ordinary images, like the ones used every day on all websites and email attachments. Download trial version and discover the freedom of incognito.\n\nENCRYPT AND HIDE YOUR CONFIDENTIAL DATA\nThe Pro version of Secret Layer supports encryption of your data:\nEncryption type: AES, Key length: 128, 196, 256 (bits)\nEncryption type: Blowfish, Key length: 128, 196, 256, 384, 448 (bits)\nEncryption type: Cast-128, Key length: 40, 64, 128 (bits)\nEncryption type: Cast-256, Key length: 128, 160, 192, 224, 256 (bits)\nEncryption type: DES, Key length: 64 (bits)\nEncryption type: IDEA, Key length: 128 (bits)\nEncryption type: RC5, Key length: 64, 128, 192, 256, 384, 448, 512, 1024, 1536, 2040 (bits)\nEncryption type: Twofish, Key length: 128, 192, 256 (bits)\n\nA container with the encrypted data is hidden inside of an ordinary-looking image. This is all done automatically and in the background: you don't have to do anything extra.\n\nDATA TRANSFERÃ¢â‚¬â€HIDDEN\nAny time you transfer an encrypted file to someone by email, Skype, or another method, anyone on your network can see that you're transferring something encrypted. But when you hide your data in a image, to everyone else it looks like you're uploading another photo to the web, just like billions of other people. In other words, your photo can slip away in the crowd, no different from everyone else.\n\nDATA EXISTENCEÃ¢â‚¬â€HIDDEN\nTo hide 1 GB of data you'll need about 5 GB of .png images.\nSo how big is your photo collection? Pretty big, right?\nBut if you happen to need more photos, or different photos, just use a macro. Quick and easy.\n\n\n \nPlatform : Windows XP/Vista/Windows 7/Windows 8/Windows 8.1\nLanguage : English\n \n\n\n================\n[INSTALL NOTES]\n================\n\n1. Install the application\n2.
