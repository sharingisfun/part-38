All of their albums are represented here from 1984's Morbid Tales to 2006's Monotheist.  Yes, even songs from the dreaded (and hated) Cold Lake cd are here.\n\nI picked the songs i like the best, ripped them to .wav files with Ashampoo and then burned my own 2-disc set. Then i decided to share it. So, i converted the .wav files to .flac with Foobar. I compiled them in the order of the year the albums were released. These are from the remasters except for Cold Lake which never was remastered.\n\nI hope they sound good for you. The only altering was combining the intro leading into the song Into The Crypts Of Rays of Morbid Tales so as to avoid that gap we all hate to hear. I didn't alter anything else as i'm not that excelled in editing music files. Of course, people have different tastes and like different songs. These are my faves.\n\nDisc 1:\n01) Intro /Into The Crypts Of Rays\n02) Visions Of Mortality\n03) Dethroned Emperor\n04) Return To The Eve\n05) The Usurper\n06) Jewel Throne\n07) Mexican Radio\n08) Mesmerized\n09) Inner Sanctum\n10) Babylon Fell (Jade Serpent)\n11) Sorrows Of The Moon\n12) (Once) They Were Eagles\n13) Cherry Orchards\n14) Blood On Kisses\n15) Downtown Hanoi\n\nDisc 2:\n16) Roses Without Thorns\n17) The Heart Beneath\n18) The Name Of My Bride\n19) The Restless Seas\n20) Phallic Tantrum\n21) Vanity\n22) Nemesis\n23) Idols Of Chagrin\n24) A Descent To Babylon (Babylon Asleep)\n25) The Inevitable Factor\n26) Journey Into Fear\n27) Under Apollyon's Sun\n28) Progeny\n29) Ground\n30) Domain of Decay\n\n\nPlease seed. Put the download where you want the folder to go. There are no zip or rar files, so there's no excuse to not seed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:170d414a581bf61c38f81cd23290f12259947d13","amp;dn":"Celtic+Frost+-+Best+Of+-+1984+to+2006","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"170d414a581bf61c38f81cd23290f12259947d13","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,13,65,74,88,27,246,28,56,248,28,210,50,144,241,34,89,148,125,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
