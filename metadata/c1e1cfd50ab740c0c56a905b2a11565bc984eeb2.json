She may \nleave the home of the Commander and his wife once a day \nto walk to food markets whose signs are now pictures \ninstead of words because women are no longer allowed to \nread. She must lie on her back once a month and pray that \nthe Commander makes her pregnant, because in an age of \ndeclining fertility, Offred and the other Handmaids are \nvalued only if their ovaries are viable. Offred can \nremember the years before, when she lived and made love \nwith her husband, Luke; when she played with and protected \nher daughter; when she had a job, money of her own, and \naccess to knowledge. But all of that is gone now...\nFunny, unexpected, horrifying, and altogether convincing, \nThe Handmaid's Tale is at once scathing satire, dire \nwarning, and tour de force.\n\n===============================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c1e1cfd50ab740c0c56a905b2a11565bc984eeb2","amp;dn":"The+Handmaid%27s+Tale+-Margaret+Atwood+%28pdf+mobi+epub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c1e1cfd50ab740c0c56a905b2a11565bc984eeb2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,225,207,213,10,183,64,192,197,106,144,91,42,17,86,91,201,132,238,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
