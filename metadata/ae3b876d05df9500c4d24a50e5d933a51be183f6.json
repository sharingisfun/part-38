The cult director, best known for the 1986 film Blue Velvet, the 1990 TV series Twin Peaks and last year&amp;#039;s The Straight Story, now spends his days in front of a home computer, making animated shorts for Shockwave.com using software called Flash.\n\nDescribing Dumbland as a weekly offering of &quot;stupid, coarse humor,&quot; Lynch sits at his Apple iMac, drawing images with his mouse, animating them, providing the voices, composing and performing the background music. All by himself.\n\n&quot;I like this (Flash) technology, and I like the company,&quot; says Lynch, 54. &quot;They&amp;#039;re the kind of people who will help define what the Internet is. It&amp;#039;s modern thinking and the right way to go.&quot;\n\n----\n\nEncoded by: sickboy88\nCodec: XviD 1.2r127\nContainer: AVI-ODML\nBitrate: 500 kb/s AVG \nAspect: 640x360 = 1.778\nAudio: English, 128 kb/s VBR MP3 @ 48K Hz\nSubtitles: None\nRuntime: 00:33:28\nFPS: 29.971\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae3b876d05df9500c4d24a50e5d933a51be183f6","amp;dn":"Dumbland+%28xvid12r127-sickboy88%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae3b876d05df9500c4d24a50e5d933a51be183f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,59,135,109,5,223,149,0,196,210,74,80,229,217,51,165,27,225,131,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
