Texas born singer-guitarist Johnny Turner (1934) fronts the band along with his friend and playing partner Zaven Jambazian (1941-2004), a talented and idiomatic harmonica player. The quartet was a fixture at The Raven and the Rose nightclub in Sierra Madre during the '70s and early '80s. The album is a perfect representation of their mainstream Chicago blues approach and energetic performance. The band's easygoing, unpretentious music was recorded on location at The Raven and the Rose during one of its regular Friday night stints.\n\n\nTracklist\n\n1. Checkin' on My Baby\n2.
