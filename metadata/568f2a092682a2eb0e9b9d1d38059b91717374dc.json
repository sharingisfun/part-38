Cat 101 - To Kill a Priest (16 Sep 1966)\n\n&quot;Out of the night comes a man who saves lives at the risk of his own. Once a circus performer, an aerialist who refused the net... once a cat burglar, a master among jewel thieves... and now, a professional bodyguard, primitive, savage, in love with danger : T.H.E CAT!&quot; In this episode, Cat feels that the police protection being given to a waterfront priest is not enough to save him from racketeers who wish to kill him.\n\nStars:\nRobert Loggia as Thomas Hewitt Edward Cat\nR.G.
