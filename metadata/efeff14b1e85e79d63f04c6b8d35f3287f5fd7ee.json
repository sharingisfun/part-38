In the song, the singer finds drinking red wine is the only way to forget a lost love.\n\nTop of the Pops, also known as TOTP, is a music chart television program, made by the BBC and originally broadcast weekly from 1 January 1964 to 30 July 2006.\n\nEach weekly program consisted of performances from some of that week's best-selling popular music artists, with a rundown of that week's singles chart. Additionally, every year there was a special edition of the program on Christmas Day featuring some of the best-selling singles of the year.\n\nUB40 made their rendition for their cover versions album Labour of Love. According to the band, they were only familiar with Tony Tribe's version, and their version featured a lighter, reggae-style flavor compared to Diamond's somber, acoustic ballad. This version reached number one in the UK chart in August 1983, and number thirty-four in the U.S. in March 1984. This cover version adds a toasted verse by UB40 member Astro, opening: &quot;Red Red Wine, you make me feel so fine/You keep me rocking all of the time&quot;.\n\nUB40 are a British reggae band formed in 1978 in Birmingham. The band has placed more than 50 singles in the UK Singles Chart, and has also achieved considerable international success. One of the world's best-selling music artists, UB40 have sold over 70 million records.\n\nTheir No.1 hit singles include their first number 1 &quot;Food for Thought&quot; and two U.S. Billboard Hot 100 number ones with &quot;Red Red Wine&quot; and &quot;Can't Help Falling in Love&quot;, while &quot;I Got You Babe&quot; also topped the UK singles chart.\n(video does not have any logos)\n\n\n     &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Red_Wine&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Red_Wine&lt;/a&gt; \n       &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_of_the_Pops&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_of_the_Pops&lt;/a&gt; \n       &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/pABLoaaEA&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/pABLoaaEA&lt;/a&gt; \n    \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic: \n   Video : MPEG2 Video 720x576 (4:3) 25fps 9128kbps\n   Audio1: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz stereo 224kbps\n   Audio2: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz 6ch 448kbps\n   Duration: 00:02:40\n\n\n*To change the audio in &quot;Media Player Classic Home Cinema&quot;, just go to &quot;Navigate&quot; then &quot;Audio Language&quot; and choose between the 2 sources*\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic Home Cinema&quot; player if you can't play this \n file, or for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \n It's 100% free to download and use.
