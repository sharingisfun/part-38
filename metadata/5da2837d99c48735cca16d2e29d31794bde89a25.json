But this time, I need something stronger.\nSo let's Rock; Cheer me Up....scotty (It won't be easy).\n\nAnd so it was. Not easy. So I switched to Metal and Gothic to find my way out there.\nThe Sound may be a bit dark colored (like I am now) but somehow fits the being-in-a-save-cellar experience.\nHereby 15 tracks of the ones that came close. One hour of Metal (and nice) Moments.....
