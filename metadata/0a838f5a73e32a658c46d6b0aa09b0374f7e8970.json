Tales of Destiny 2 is easily confused with the name of the North American release of Tales of Eternia, Tales of Destiny II, which was renamed since the name &quot;Eternia&quot; is trademarked by Mattel (for the He-Man toys) in North America. Tales of Destiny 2's characteristic genre name is To Release Destiny RPG (ÃƒÂ©Ã‚ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬Â¹ÃƒÂ¥Ã¢â‚¬ËœÃ‚Â½ÃƒÂ£Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÂ¨Ã‚Â§Ã‚Â£ÃƒÂ£Ã‚ï¿½Ã‚ï¿½ÃƒÂ¦Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã‚Â¾ÃƒÂ£Ã‚ï¿½Ã‚Â¤RPG, Unmei wo tokihanatsu RPG?). In carrying on the traditions of the Tales series, Tales of Destiny 2 relies on such mainstays as the Linear Motion Battle System and sprite-based characters. Like most games in the series, Tales of Destiny 2 includes an introduction and insert-scenes animated by Production I.G, and a J-pop theme song - in this case, Key to My Heart by Mai Kuraki.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWant to Make it Working on your Blank DVD ?
