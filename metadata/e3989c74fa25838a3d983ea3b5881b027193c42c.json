This is my 4-track EP that I've been working on for a few months now and am just trying to upload my music to as many sources as possible! I've delved into making computer music a little over a year ago now when I was traveling throughout Europe. My friends have inspired me to dig deeper in honing my abilities with making music and music is my passion! I've been playing guitar for over 6 years now and am planning on forming a band as well. I invite you to join me on my journey as a musician, and I hope to hear suggestions or advice on improvement. I'm constantly making new tracks and am looking to collaborate with musicians locally or online.\n\nHope to hear from you soon, and thanks again for downloading my EP!\nChris\n\nFollow me on Soundcloud! Just type in typical soundcloud link then add /cdkc_official to the end!\n\nFeedback is always appreciated! :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3989c74fa25838a3d983ea3b5881b027193c42c","amp;dn":"RIASIG+%5BEP%5D+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3989c74fa25838a3d983ea3b5881b027193c42c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,152,156,116,250,37,131,138,61,152,62,163,181,136,27,2,113,147,196,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
