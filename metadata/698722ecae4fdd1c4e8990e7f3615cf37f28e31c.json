Sometime in the not-so-distant future, this may be a reality. Taking a step towards that future, An Atlas of Human Blastocysts vividly illustrates the typical and atypical morphology of mammalian blastocysts. The atlas demonstrates that extended culture of blastocysts is now achieveable in the laboratory and points us toward the day when it will be possible to choose between a number of healthy hatched blastocysts","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:698722ecae4fdd1c4e8990e7f3615cf37f28e31c","amp;dn":"An+Atlas+of+Human+Blastocysts.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"698722ecae4fdd1c4e8990e7f3615cf37f28e31c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,135,34,236,174,79,221,28,78,137,144,231,243,97,92,243,127,40,227,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
