Jonas often said that without \r\nthe support of his family, and in particular his mother, LRG would never have \r\ncome into fruition. As LRG grew and time progressed, 1947 grew to become a \r\nsymbol of family, of love, and of dedication to something greater than oneâ€™s \r\nself. 1947 is our second full-length skate video, named in honor of Jonas and \r\nhis family, and in recognition of the unity of our team and the importance of \r\nbeing part of something greater. From the skateboarders to the people behind \r\nthe scenes supporting the video and the brand, LRG remains a family operation.\r\n\r\nFeaturing: Tom Asta, Miles Silvas, Rodrigo TX, Felipe Gustavo, Trent McClung, \r\nCarlos Ribeiro, Jack Curtin, Chico Brenes and Tommy Sandoval.\r\n\r\nDirected by Kyle Camarillo","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:30051f5695e4137277e9d6f87205e971248fba82","amp;dn":"LRG+Skateboarding+1947+2015+1080p+x264-Search4Chin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"30051f5695e4137277e9d6f87205e971248fba82","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,5,31,86,149,228,19,114,119,233,214,248,114,5,233,113,36,143,186,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
