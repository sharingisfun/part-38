Award-winning journalist John Pilger investigates the discrepancies between American and British claims for the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœwar on terrorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and the facts on the ground as he finds them in Afghanistan and Washington, DC. In 2001, as the bombs began to drop, George W. Bush promised Afghanistan Ã¢â‚¬Å“the generosity of America and its alliesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Now, the familiar old warlords are regaining power, religious fundamentalism is renewing its grip and military skirmishes continue routinely. In Ã¢â‚¬Å“liberatedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Afghanistan, America has its military base and pipeline access, while the people have the warlords who are, says one woman, Ã¢â‚¬Å“in many ways worse than the TalibanÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n\nIn Washington, Pilger conducts a series of remarkable interviews with William Kristol, editor of the Weekly Standard, and leading Administration officials such as Douglas Feith, Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, and John Bolton, Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security. These people, and the other architects of the Project for the New American Century, were dismissed as Ã¢â‚¬Ëœthe craziesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ by the first Bush Administration in the early 90s when they first presented their ideas for pre-emptive strikes and world domination.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis download also contains the following videos:\nObama and the plan for World War 3_ Best documentary of the Year 2013\nIs the USA in End Times Prophecy\nEuphrates River Drying Up\n\n\n\nThe Entire Collection can be found here: &lt;a href=&quot; http://conspiracyhub.com/membershares.php?it=41&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://conspiracyhub.com/membershares.php?it=41&lt;/a&gt;\n\nJESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.\n\nBorn of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.\n\n\nRAPtURE (My transportation outta here).\n\nThe Blessed Hope.  If you believe in The Rapture you better believe That The Sacrificed Blood of Jesus, on the Cross paid for your sins and there is NOTHING Else you can do to gain Salvation, The GRACE of Christ did it ALL. Now you just have to believe that with all your Heart, Mind and Soul or Maybe Get Left Behind. All PAST, Present and Future Sins are Forgiven with Jesus. (I wouldn't PUSH That Future sin statement to much!!!)\n\nIn a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed..\n\n&quot;And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT TRUMPET and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.\n\n&quot;Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs will hear His voice,  Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in The Air, and there we will be forever be with him...\n\nMay Yahweh Bless You as He has me. Seed Long and Prosper from the Blessings of our Lord. I have asked the Father to Bless all those that Seed Long.  \n\nDo Not believe anything you find here, search the Scriptures daily to determine the tRUtH.    \n\n\nGet info on the Take Over by The New World Order Below\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://end-times-prophecy.com/blog/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://end-times-prophecy.com/blog/&lt;/a&gt;                                                                        Prophecy from Susan Davis.
