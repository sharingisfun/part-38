Using Antonio as his collateral, he borrows money from Shylock. But when the debt comes due, Shylock demands repayment in the form of a pound of Antonio's flesh. \r\n\r\nMy notes\r\n\r\n   Shoutcast released this version of Merchant of Venice recently.  \r\nThe quality by today's standards is VHS and that might have been the source from which it was digitized.\r\n\r\n   I have in the loninappleton collection a number of Merchant of Venice productions.  The one missing, if it exists,  would be the Joseph Papp Public Theatre production with George C. Scott as Shylock.  \r\n\r\n   Each of the Merchant of Venice productions has special features.  The\r\nhighlight in this one of course is Olivier here seen as an Edwardian banker.  The Trevor Nunn production also on TPB in my collection is set\r\nin pre-War Nazi Germany.  This is played up in a cabaret scene in which the music is a genius stroke. There is a more recent one just below this entry in my group from The Royal Shakespeare Company directed by Polly Findlay.  Here again the production has a special look","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:144086f2f953c14567cfa78e553684784529a60a","amp;dn":"The+Merchant+of+Venice+w.+Laurence+Olivier++%281973%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"144086f2f953c14567cfa78e553684784529a60a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,64,134,242,249,83,193,69,103,207,167,142,85,54,132,120,69,41,166,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
