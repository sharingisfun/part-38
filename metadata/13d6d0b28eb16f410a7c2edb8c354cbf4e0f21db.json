I'm just copying it over.\n\nDescription: Atari Age was a magazine distributed to Atari Club members from 1982 until 1984. It was published by The Atari Club Inc., a subsidiary of Atari, Inc.\n\nCreated in 1982, Atari Age was given to all Atari Club members as a perk for joining the club. Upon paying the US$1 club membership fee, the member would also receive a year's subscription to Atari Age. The magazine regularly featured content related to all things Atari. This included coverage of Atari-related news, coverage of Atari-related events, exclusive looks at new products from Atari, technical articles, exclusive offers to Atari Club members, and a full catalog of Atari-related merchandise and paraphernalia.[2]\n\nAtari Age ceased publication in 1984, after Warner Communications sold the consumer division of Atari to Jack Tramiel.\n\nReference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_Age","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:13d6d0b28eb16f410a7c2edb8c354cbf4e0f21db","amp;dn":"Atari+Age+Magazine","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"13d6d0b28eb16f410a7c2edb8c354cbf4e0f21db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,214,208,178,142,177,111,65,10,124,46,219,140,53,76,191,78,15,33,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
