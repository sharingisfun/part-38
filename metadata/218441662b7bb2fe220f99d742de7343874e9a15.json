Sawyer is perfect, a regular Prince Charming, but when he leaves town for the summer, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s his cousin Beau who catches AshtonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s eye. Beau is the sexiest guy sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ever seen, and even though heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dangerous, Ashton is drawn to him.\n\nBeau loves his cousin like a brother, so the last thing he wants to do is make a move on SawyerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s girl. Ashton is off-limits, absolutely. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s why he does his best to keep his distance, even though heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been in love with her forever. When Ashton wants to rekindle their childhood friendship in SawyerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s absence, Beau knows he should say no.\n\nAshton and Beau donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want to hurt Sawyer. But the more they try to stay away from each other, the more intense their urges become. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s getting way too hard to resist....\n\nThe Vincent Brothers (The Vincent Boys #2) by Abbi Glines (June 2012) \n\nGetting a boy to fall head-over-heels in love with you isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t easy.

Lana has a chance to make Sawyer see her, and sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s taking it. If only heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d get over AshtonÃ¢â‚¬â€because Lana is sick of second-best.\n\nSawyerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s heart is broken. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lost his best girl to his best friend. And then Lana comes to town. AshtonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cousin has always been sweet and soft-spoken, but now sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s drop-dead gorgeous as well. Sawyer doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know if Lana can heal his broken heart, but spending time with her might at least make Ashton jealous.\n\nWhat starts as a carefree fling becomes a lusty game of seduction. Sawyer and Lana may have different motives, but their scintillating hookups are the same kind of steamy. . . .\n\n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:218441662b7bb2fe220f99d742de7343874e9a15","amp;dn":"The+Vincent+Boys+Series+%281-2%29+by+Abbi+Glines+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"218441662b7bb2fe220f99d742de7343874e9a15","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,132,65,102,43,123,178,254,34,15,153,215,66,222,115,67,135,78,154,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
