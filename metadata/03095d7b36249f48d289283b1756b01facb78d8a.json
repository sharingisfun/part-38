With up to 85% of 'BC Bud' being exported to the United States, the trade has become an international issue. Follow filmmaker Adam Scorgie as he demystifies the underground market and brings to light how an industry can function while remaining illegal. Through growers, police officers, criminologists, economists, doctors, politicians and pop culture icons, Scorgie examines the cause and effect nature of the business - an industry that may be profiting more by being illegal.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:03095d7b36249f48d289283b1756b01facb78d8a","amp;dn":"The+Union%3A+The+Business+Behind+Getting+High","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"03095d7b36249f48d289283b1756b01facb78d8a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,9,93,123,54,36,159,72,210,137,40,59,23,86,176,31,172,183,141,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
