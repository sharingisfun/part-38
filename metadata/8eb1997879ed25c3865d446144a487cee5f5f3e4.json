The four writers then reached out through their metal rolodexes to a diverse lineup of performers, each adding their own personal musical stamp to the collection of nine original songs. More information on the performers and individual track lineups will be released in the near future. The debut album from METAL ALLEGIANCE is slated for release in fall 2015. Stemming from an initial idea in 2011, METAL ALLEGIANCE was born as a way to unite a collection of hard rock and heavy metalÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most notable musicians in a setting born under one ideal, a love of music and performing. In 2015, that ideal still holds true and has become the foundation for everything METAL ALLEGIANCE; furthered with the release of the upcoming debut album. While the lineup may change, the passion, the energy and the emotion all remain the same. METAL ALLEGIANCE is more than just a record or a concert, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an experience and a lifestyle","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8eb1997879ed25c3865d446144a487cee5f5f3e4","amp;dn":"METAL+ALLEGIANCE+-+Metal+Allegiance+%282015%29+%5BThras+Metal%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8eb1997879ed25c3865d446144a487cee5f5f3e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,177,153,120,121,237,37,195,134,93,68,97,68,164,135,206,229,245,243,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
