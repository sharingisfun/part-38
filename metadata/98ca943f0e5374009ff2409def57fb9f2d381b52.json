Uzbek is farsi based but part turkish as well.  I heard her while in Uzbekistan on deployment to Afghanistan.  Then heard her on Hearts of Space.  Track #11 will calm you down.\n\nUber relaxing.  This might be in instrumental or folk or even new age areas of a store.\n\nif you know any other artists like her let me know.\nYou might also check out the other Jalan Jalan upload I put up.\nRem\n\n\noops, was confusing Uzbek with Afghan, it was all in the same deployment that I visited the Stans.  But Uzbeks were the friendliest :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:98ca943f0e5374009ff2409def57fb9f2d381b52","amp;dn":"Sevara+Nazarkhan+%28-Uzbek%29+Yol+Bolsin.zip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"98ca943f0e5374009ff2409def57fb9f2d381b52","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,202,148,63,14,83,116,0,159,242,64,157,239,87,251,159,45,56,27,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
