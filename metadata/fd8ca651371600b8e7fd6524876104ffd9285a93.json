Wobble is far more interested in experimentation than simply adding world sounds to pop music. The tracks with Middle Eastern influences, including the amazing &quot;Everyman's an Island,&quot; are quite remarkable and most feature the fine talents of Natasha Atlas. Meanwhile, the trance-like opener, &quot;Visions of You,&quot; which guests SinÃƒÂ©ad O'Connor on vocals, is absolutely beautiful. On the title track, Wobble even returns to his past, with he and guitarist Justin Adams bringing the sound of early PiL forward ten years.
