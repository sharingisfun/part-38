At every turn\nAmerican&amp;#039;s are challenged to provide a social security number. You need a social security\nnumber for school, insurance, employment, banking, credit and a driver&amp;#039;s license; even your\ndentist or doctor is likely to ask you for a social security number. Yet millions of natural born\nAmericans do not have social security numbers. They do not have a social security number\nbecause they don&amp;#039;t want one and, to the surprise of most Americans&amp;#039; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ they are not required\nto have one!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:96a8c9c8b6047bd2464f6789ea258d72f2cab14b","amp;dn":"no+social+security+number","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"96a8c9c8b6047bd2464f6789ea258d72f2cab14b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,168,201,200,182,4,123,210,70,79,103,137,234,37,141,114,242,202,177,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
