The likes of Fairport Convention and The Incredible String Band achieved Top 5 albums and headlined festivals, sitting comfortably alongside other pioneering acts as part of a post-Summer of Love mainstream music scene that was embracing experimentation like never before.\nGlasgowÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Trembling Bells would almost certainly have thrived in that era and it is rather a shame that in todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s less radical climate they are almost certainly destined to remain niche curiosities. The Sovereign Self, their fifth album since forming in 2008, is a confident, richly textured record that will offer much to enjoy for those willing to seek it out.\nFirst track Ã¢â‚¬ËœTween The Womb And The Tomb tells you all you need to know about Trembling Bells. Clocking in at a shade over eight minutes, it begins with singer Lavinia BlackwellÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s soaring, passionate vocal Ã¢â‚¬â€œ somewhere between Sandy Denny and Siouxsie Sioux Ã¢â‚¬â€œ which is soon joined by a jagged, raga like guitar motif. Around the half way mark, we get a sudden, unexpected flurry of King Crimson-like organ cascades before the tempo shifts again towards more conventional folk balladry. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a heady brew, but pulled off with panache and fine musicianship.\n\nThe following seven tracks are no less compelling. OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Where is St George sees band founder Alex Neilson and Blackwell alternating then harmonising their vocals, chanting lyrics that teeter precariously between genius and madness, for example imagining a time Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ã¢â‚¬Å“where Lou Reed and Lauren Bacall/defeated Asterix the Gaul.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ These eclectic references are perhaps unsurprising when you consider the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s title is taken from a Dennis Potter TV play and its cover includes a series of paintings by Blackwell depicting everyone from the aforementioned Reed to the reclusive poet Emily Dickinson and ancient Greek tragedian Aeschylus. Coldplay they certainly ainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t.\n\nBack to the music, and while The Singing Blood and Sweet Death Polka are lovely but (by Trembling Bells standards) relatively vanilla (a mad wig out at the end on the latter notwithstanding), Bells Of Burford is something else entirely Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a monolithic slab of progressive rock boasting guitar and keyboard pyrotechnics that would even make Yes pause for thought.\n\nOver these seven minutes of controlled mayhem, Trembling Bells arguably travel further beyond their starting point in traditional folk music than any act in the genre has ever done before. It is a startling piece of work from a group who seem willing to try anything. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s almost a surprise that we donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t see hip hop or dubstep worked in somewhere. Album closer I Is Someone Else is almost as stellar, with BlackwellÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s strident voice propelling The Sovereign Self towards a conclusion of duelling electric guitar solos that once again is about as far removed from real ale and knitted sweater stereotypes as itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s possible to get. The addition of second guitarist Alasdair C Mitchell has added extra muscularity to the already potent riffs and rhythms of the groupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s previous records, and the sound created is frequently extraordinary.\n\nSprawling, strange, baffling and beguiling, this psychedelic treasure is unlikely to appeal to the unadventurous, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hard to imagine there will be another album released anywhere this year thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s quite like it.\nRating 9.7/10\n\n\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n01 - 'Tween the Womb and the Tomb.flac\n02 - O, Where Is Saint George.flac\n03 - Killing Time in London Fields.flac\n04 - Sweet Death Polka.flac\n05 - Bells of Burford.flac\n06 - The Singing Blood.flac\n07 - (Perched Like a Drunk on A) Miserichord.flac\n08 - I Is Someone Else.flac\n\n\nSummary:\nCountry: Sctoland\nGenre: Indie-Folk\nStyles:\n\n\nMedia Report:\nSource : CD\nFormat : FLAC\nFormat/Info : Free Lossless Audio Codec, 16-bit PCM\nBit rate mode : Variable\nBit rate : ~669-836 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\nBit depth : 16 bits","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29e872fdadeec3a8d28568a620cc0b5756951fd4","amp;dn":"%282015%29+Trembling+Bells+-+The+Sovereign+Self+%5BFLAC%2CTracks%5D+%7B100.X","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29e872fdadeec3a8d28568a620cc0b5756951fd4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,232,114,253,173,238,195,168,210,133,104,166,32,204,11,87,86,149,31,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
