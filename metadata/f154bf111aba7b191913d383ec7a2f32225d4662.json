At the first Kind Of Blue session one of the three track machines was running slow.  As it happens the master takes used on the original LP and all subsequent reissues were pulled from the reels recorded on that machine.  They were recorded at the wrong speed.  As a result the first three tunes always appeared in sharp pitch until this edition of the album.  Here we have included the music as the musicians played it (newly remixed on an all tube three track Presto machine much like the one used for the original recordings).  Also included is the only complete alternate take from these historic sessions.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f154bf111aba7b191913d383ec7a2f32225d4662","amp;dn":"MILES+DAVIS+Kind+Of+Blue+%28Columbia+CK+64935%29+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f154bf111aba7b191913d383ec7a2f32225d4662","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,84,191,17,26,186,123,25,25,19,211,131,236,122,47,50,34,93,70,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
