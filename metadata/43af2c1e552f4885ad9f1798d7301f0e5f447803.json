It?s an interesting mini-dissertation on Zip Guns. Not really on how to make ?em but on the issue of Safety. Photos are not all that? They may have been taken with a cheap ?phone camera. You can bet the author won?t be nominated for a Pulitzer, but they certainly serve the purpose intended. You don?t require a password for ?read-only? access, but only just to edit it (for a G-rating?). It reads as though the Writer intends this to be a Public Service-type offering, perhaps even ?In-Service Safety Training? material for Law Enforcement?s thankless presence on the streets! But ?Lord Only Knows? just how long he?s been sitting on it nurturing a jock itch! Anyway, here it is now available for public reading!
