It is the band's first studio album since 2005's Stand Up and the first release since the death of saxophonist LeRoi Moore. Guitarist Tim Reynolds played on the album, marking his first recording with DMB since 1998Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Before These Crowded Streets. Rashawn Ross makes his first appearance on a DMB studio album since joining as a regular touring member in 2006 as well as Jeff Coffin, who has taken Moore's role since June 2008. The album was the first to be produced by Rob Cavallo, and first single on this album has been made available on their website.  The album is the second major release by Dave Matthews Band with a vinyl edition. Before These Crowded Streets is the only other album to have been released on that medium, albeit in a limited number.  The album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, selling 424,000 copies in its first week of release. This marked the group's fifth consecutive studio album to open with a sales week of at least 400,000 copies.  Exactly six months after its release, Big Whiskey &amp; the GrooGrux King was nominated for two Grammy Awards: Best Rock Album and Album of the Year, but lost to Green Day's 21st Century Breakdown and Taylor Swift's Fearless, respectively..\n\n \n\nCD Track Listings\n\n[01] Grux\n[02] Shake Me Like A Monkey\n[03] Funny The Way It Is\n[04] Lying In The Hands Of God\n[05] Why I Am\n[06] Dive In\n[07] Spaceman\n[08] Squirm\n[09] Alligator Pie\n[10] Seven\n[11] Time Bomb\n[12] Baby Blue\n[13] You &amp; Me\n[14] Write A Song\n[15] Corn Bread\n\nCD Play Time - 01h:03m:10s\n\nTotal File Size....................... 468mb (Including FLAC + Logs, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat / Info.......................
