Allen sketches the diversity of the Reformed tradition through the past five centuries, whilst at the same time highlighting its continuity with regard to certain theological emphases. In so doing, Allen accentuates that Reformed theology is marked by both formal (`the always reforming church') and material (`the Reformed church') interests.`Clear, calm and illuminating, this book offers a loving and generous commendation of the classical Reformed tradition of doctrine and spiritual practice.' John Webster, Frse, University of Aberdeen, UK`Allen's account of Reformed theology admirably joins clarity with precision, accessibility with gravity, and conviction with charity. Especially strong is the book's thorough attention to major Reformed figures like John Calvin and Karl Barth and major statements of Reformed faith like the Heidelberg Catechism and the Westminster Confession. While Allen does not shy away from full treatment of differences among Reformed theologians, his accent rests upon the distinctive ways in which Reformed Theology incorporates and interprets the historic Christian message. This book is a splendid introduction for those who are in Reformed churches and an inviting invitation to dialogue with those who are not.' Mark a. Noll, University of Notre Dame, USA`This is a splendid volume. Drawing deeply from the past while engaging a wide variety of contemporary voices, this book nevertheless summarizes the richness of Reformed teaching with clarity and insight. Allen focuses on the main issues and beneath the superb brevity lies a deep reservoir of research.' Michael Horton, Westminster Seminary California, USA","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:73965caedc8f29a976e40c740c0c73b0bf42697d","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B2010%5D+Reformed+Theology","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"73965caedc8f29a976e40c740c0c73b0bf42697d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,150,92,174,220,143,41,169,118,228,12,116,12,12,115,176,191,66,105,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
