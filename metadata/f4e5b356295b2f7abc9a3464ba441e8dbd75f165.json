With his stylish good looks and mild rock &amp; roll, he became one of the top teen idols of the era; luckily, he had the support of the legendary songwriting team of Doc Pomus and Mort Shuman, who provided him with &quot;Turn Me Loose,&quot; &quot;Hound Dog Man,&quot; and &quot;I'm a Man,&quot; among other songs. Fabian's fame peaked in 1959 with the million-selling &quot;Tiger&quot; single; after that, he valiantly tried to become a movie star. When Congress fingered him as one of the performers who benefited from payola, his already-ailing career was given a nearly fatal blow; under questioning, Fabian explained that his records featured a substantial amount of electronic doctoring in order to improve his voice. After the hearings, he starred in some more movies in the '60s, without regaining the audience of his peak years.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:09foxqy5ldke&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:09foxqy5ldke&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review:\n\nIt's true that Fabian couldn't sing, but that's really beside the point. He worked with talented instrumentalists and songwriters (Mort Shuman and Doc Pomus to name a couple), rocked harder than the average teen idol, and stuck with material that didn't challenge his already challenged vocal talents. This Is Fabian collects 26 original recordings for the Chancellor label, including all ten of his Billboard hits. &quot;Tiger,&quot; &quot;Turn Me Loose,&quot; and &quot;Hound Dog Man&quot; are the ones people remember, but some of the non-hits are fine as well (check out the amazing guitar solo on &quot;Mighty Cold&quot; for one example). Collectables has issued an equally generous Fabian anthology domestically, but This is Fabian! remains a fine and comprehensive collection of his hit recordings.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:fbfixqq5ldse&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:fbfixqq5ldse&lt;/a&gt;\n\nReviews and for sale here: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000007YS0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000007YS0&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
