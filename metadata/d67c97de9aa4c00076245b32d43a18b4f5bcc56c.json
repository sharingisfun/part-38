He moved to Minneapolis in 1999 to attend North Central University.\n\n\n\n\nHis first album, The Alcatraz Kid, quickly garnered the attention of the local media, resulting in Messersmith being named the &quot;premier under-30 songwriter in the Twin Cities&quot; by City Pages.The Alcatraz Kid also received the attention of Performing Songwriter Magazine, a national publication that stated, &quot;Remember the way you felt the first time you heard the amazing harmonies of Simon and Garfunkel? That subdued, magical sound lives once more on Jeremy MessersmithÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s The Alcatraz Kid, but this time with a 21st-century twist. Messersmith lulls with his gentle voice and overdubbed harmonies, easing the shock of his sometimes-harsh lyrics. Quirky? Certainly. Will you like it? No doubt.&quot; This may also remind you to the music and lyrics of Elliott Smith.\n\nThe title &quot;The Alcatraz Kid&quot; was inspired by a man who used the name to prank-call where Messersmith worked.\n\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n01 - The Alcatraz Kid 00:27\n02 - Novocain 03:20\n03 - Easy Lovers, Hardly Friends 03:21\n04 - Snow Day 03:03\n05 - Day Job 02:33\n06 - Scientists 03:31\n07 - Super Frog Saves Tokyo 00:23\n08 - Great Times 03:12\n09 - Beautiful Children 03:55\n10 - 7:02 02:31\n11 - Old Skin 04:13 \n\n\n\nMore info: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Messersmith&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Messersmith&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.jeremymessersmith.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.jeremymessersmith.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nENJOY &amp; REMEMBER TO KEEP SEEDING FOR OTHERS!!\nTHANKS!\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d67c97de9aa4c00076245b32d43a18b4f5bcc56c","amp;dn":"Jeremy+Messersmith+-+The+Alcatraz+Kid+%282006%29%28Indie+Folk+Rock+Pop","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d67c97de9aa4c00076245b32d43a18b4f5bcc56c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,124,151,222,154,164,192,0,118,36,91,50,212,58,24,180,245,188,197,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
