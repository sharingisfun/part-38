Manson Family represents a small stable of rappers associated with Wright: K-Rocafella, C-Rocafella, C-9, Princess Loko, Lil' Sko, Mac T-Dog, and producer Maceo. Many of these rappers display remarkable skills, and Maceo's production proves evocative, with its horror film ambience and mid-tempo drum machine bounce.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9926652ad20b5261150e51159a6ac2d0103beb31","amp;dn":"manson+family+..+memphis+rap+1998+-+2000","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9926652ad20b5261150e51159a6ac2d0103beb31","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,38,101,42,210,11,82,97,21,14,81,21,154,106,194,208,16,59,235,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
