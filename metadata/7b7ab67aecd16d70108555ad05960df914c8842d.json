Sarah Swagger [Radio Edit] (3:57)\n\n\n No rest for the creative mind of MaRLo. The last drop of &quot;BOOM&quot; has yet to sound, but his new one is already hammered by the big jocks.\n Premiered on Armin's A State of Trance show and indulging many, is the stunning &quot;Always Be Around&quot; feat. Sarah Swagger. Being able to perform magic on both instrumental as well as vocal tracks is a rare gift. In the case of Australia's Marlo Hoogstraten, it's an easy one though. He's done both instrumental beasts, such as &quot;Lightning&quot;, &quot;Megalodon&quot; and &quot;Jaguar&quot;, and vocal beauties - &quot;The Island&quot;, &quot;Just Breathe&quot; - alike. Equally big and ready for impact, is his latest offer on the A State of Trance label. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b7ab67aecd16d70108555ad05960df914c8842d","amp;dn":"Marlo+Feat.+Sarah+Swagger+-+Always+Be+Around+%282013%29+Single+%40+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b7ab67aecd16d70108555ad05960df914c8842d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,122,182,122,236,209,109,112,16,133,85,173,5,150,13,249,20,200,132,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
