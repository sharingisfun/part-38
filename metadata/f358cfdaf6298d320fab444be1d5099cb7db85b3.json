Less well known--even to avid horror fans--are the many other memorable films based on literary works. Beginning in the silent era and continuing to the present, numerous horror films found their inspiration in novels, novellas, short stories and poems, though many of these written works are long forgotten.\nThis book examines 43 works of literature--from the famous to the obscure--that provided the basis for 62 horror films. Both the written works and the films are analyzed critically, with an emphasis on the symbiosis between the two. Background on the authors and their writings is provided","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f358cfdaf6298d320fab444be1d5099cb7db85b3","amp;dn":"Classic+Horror+Films+and+the+Literature+That+Inspired+Them+-2015","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f358cfdaf6298d320fab444be1d5099cb7db85b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,88,207,218,246,41,141,50,15,171,68,75,225,213,9,156,183,219,133,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
