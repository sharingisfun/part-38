Set in late-'30s New Orleans, the story centers upon a roguish German shepherd named Charlie B. Barkin (voice of Burt Reynolds), who is killed early in the proceedings by his business partner, Carface (voice of Vic Tayback). Charlie travels to Heaven, and is promptly warned that if he heads back to Earth, he can never return; he does decide to go back to Earth, however, to exact revenge on Carface, who has kidnapped Anne-Marie, a little orphan girl who can talk to Animals. \nThe film also includes the vocal skills of Dom DeLuise, Charles Nelson Reilly, Vic Tayback, Melba Moore, Loni Anderson, and a host of others. All Dogs Go to Heaven was the first production of the Dublin-based Sullivan Bluth Studios. ~ Hal Erickson, All Movie Guide\n\nTheatrical Feature Running Time: 85 mins \nComplete Cast:\nBurt Reynolds - Charlie\nDom DeLuise - Itchy\nCharles Nelson Reilly - Killer\nCandy Devine - Vera\nLoni Anderson - Flo\nAnna Manahan - Stella Dallas\nGodfrey Quigley - Terrier\nDan Kuenster\nDick Zondag\nMark Swan\nJudith Barsi - Anne-Marie\nVic Tayback - Carface\nMelba Moore - Whippet Angel\nKen Page - King Gator\nRobert Fuller - Harold\nNigel Pegram - Sir Reginald\nJohn K.
