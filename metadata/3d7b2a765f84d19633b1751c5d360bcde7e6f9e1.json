RockyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s younger brother Cody (The Blood Brothers) soon joined the band on second guitar, and the band recorded their debut 7ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ for HenryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Finest Recordings. In 1999, Second Nature Recordings released their first full-length, entitled ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“For Madmen OnlyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢. Blending straight-up rock with elements of post-hardcore, and CodyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s metal reminiscent guitaring, Waxwing soon established a strong local following. It was a feat built upon with their two succeeding albums ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“One For the RideÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ (2000) and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Nobody Can Take What Everybody OwnsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ (2002).\n(from last.fm)\n\nThe band's 2001 release, Intervention: Collection+Remix, collected the band's numerous vinyl and compilation appearances and a handful of live and rare tracks.\n(from Wikipedia)\n\n\n01 - Intervention.mp3\n02 - Kill The Messenger.mp3\n03 - Manicotti.mp3\n04 - Charmageddon.mp3\n05 - Laboratory.mp3\n06 - All Of My Prophets (Live).mp3\n07 - New Year's Day (Live).mp3\n08 - Laboratory (Live).mp3\n09 - Spanish Remix.mp3\n\n\nMP3 details: LAME 3.97b -V 2 --vbr-new\nEAC secure rip","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d7b2a765f84d19633b1751c5d360bcde7e6f9e1","amp;dn":"Waxwing+-+Intervention%3A+Collection+%2B+Remix","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d7b2a765f84d19633b1751c5d360bcde7e6f9e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,123,42,118,95,132,209,150,51,177,117,28,93,54,11,205,231,230,249,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
