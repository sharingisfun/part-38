Paul Kersey (Charles Bronson)\nis a liberal architect living in New York City. One day, a group of\ndrug-crazed thugs break into his apartment while he's gone, killing\nhis wife Joanna (Hope Lange) and brutally raping his married daughter.\n\nDeath Wish II 1982.\nPaul Kersey's (Charles Bronson) self-appointed one-man vigilante squad goes\nbi-coastal in Michael Winner's sequel to his Death Wish. Kersey has taken up\nresidence in Los Angeles, but lunatic violence follows him across the country\nlike toilet paper sticking to his shoe. Kersey's Spanish cook is immediately\ngang-banged and killed, while his daughter, still suffering from a catatonic\nstupor after her brutal rape in the first film, finds herself raped yet again.\n\nDeath Wish 3 1985.\nMichael Winner ups the ante once again in Death Wish 3. Any pretense of Paul\nKersey (Charles Bronson) having a career in architecture is completely gone.\nKersey's new career appears to be as a professional vigilante, blowing away\nmuggers, rapists and thieves off the mean streets -- or as he terms it\n&quot;thinning the herd.&quot; Back in New York City, Kersey, with his usual luck,\narrives just in time to find an old friend dying after a vicious beating\nby a multi-cultural gang of thugs.\n\nDeath Wish 4 The Crackdown 1987.\nThe Crackdown is a 1987 action thriller film, and the fourth installment\nin the Death Wish film series. It features Charles Bronson, who reprises\nhis leading role as Paul Kersey. In Death Wish 4, Kersey is once again\nforced to become a vigilante after his girlfriend's daughter dies of a\ndrug overdose. He is recruited by tabloid owner Nathan White\n(John P. Ryan) to take down various crime figures of the Los Angeles\ndrug trade.\n\nDeath Wish V The Face of Death 1994.\nThe Face of Death is a 1994 action thriller film, and the fifth installment\nin the Death Wish series. It features Charles Bronson, who reprises his\nrole as Paul Kersey in his final theatrical starring role. In the film,\nKersey battles mobsters as he tries to protect his girlfriend (played by\nLesley-Anne Down) from her ex-husband, mob boss Tommy O'Shea (Michael Parks).\n\nDeath Wish 1 Stars.\n=&gt;-Charles Bronson.\n=&gt;-Hope Lange.\n\nDeath Wish 1 Director.\n=&gt;-Michael Winner.\n\nDeath Wish 2 Stars.\n=&gt;-Charles Bronson.\n=&gt;-Ben Frank.\n\nDeath Wish 2 Director.\n=&gt;-Michael Winner.\n\nDeath Wish 3 Stars.\n=&gt;-Charles Bronson.\n=&gt;-Deborah Raffin.\n\nDeath Wish 3 Director.\n=&gt;-Michael Winner.\n\nDeath Wish 4 Stars.\n=&gt;-Charles Bronson.\n=&gt;-Kay Lenz.\n\nDeath Wish 4 Director.\n=&gt;-J.
