So naturally Pocket is at his brainless, elderly liege's side when LearÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½at the insidious urging of Edmund, the bastard (in every way imaginable) son of the Earl of GloucesterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½demands that his kids swear their undying love and devotion before a collection of assembled guests. Of course Goneril and Regan are only too happy to brownnose Dad. But Cordelia believes that her father's request is kind of . . . well . . . stupid, and her blunt honesty ends up costing her her rightful share of the kingdom and earns her a banishment to boot.\n\nWell, now the bangers and mash have really hit the fan. The whole damn country's about to go to hell in a handbasket because of a stubborn old fart's wounded pride. And the only person who can possibly make things right . . . is Pocket, a small and slight clown with a biting sense of humor. He's already managed to sidestep catastrophe (and the vengeful blades of many an offended nobleman) on numerous occasions, using his razor-sharp mind, rapier wit . . . and the equally well-honed daggers he keeps conveniently hidden behind his back. Now he's going to have to do some very fancy maneuveringÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½cast some spells, incite a few assassinations, start a war or two (the usual stuff)ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½to get Cordelia back into Daddy Lear's good graces, to derail the fiendish power plays of Cordelia's twisted sisters, to rescue his gigantic, gigantically dim, and always randy friend and apprentice fool, Drool, from repeated beatings . . . and to shag every lusciously shaggable wench who's amenable to shagging along the way.\n\nPocket may be a fool . . . but he's definitely not an idiot.
