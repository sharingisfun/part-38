As Rachel is\n                walking home, she is narrowly missed by a car which\n                then smashes into the side of the road. The next day,\n                she learns that the crash is linked to the disturbing\n                information she found out about Nick's affair with a\n                juror. Was Rachel targeted - and could Nick have had\n                something to do with it? The latest case for the team\n                is that of a teenager shot dead at home. His best\n                friend witnessed the shooting but it takes all of\n                Janet's skill to get him to open up as he is\n                petrified that he could be next. Meanwhile, Rachel's\n                career hangs in the balance as Gill discovers just\n                how far she has gone in pursuit of love, and Janet\n                needs to end her affair once and for all.\n\n\n                                                      \n                                       \n                                                \n                                        \n                                         \n                                                \n                                                                     \n                          RiPPERS NOTES:                           \n                                                                      \n\n\n                Enjoy this great release from BiA\n\n                                                      \n                                       \n                                                \n                                        \n                                         \n                                                \n                                                                     \n                           GROUP NOTES:                            \n                                                                      \n\n                                   Greetz to \n\n                            FoV SFM TBS XiSO SAiNTS\n\n                            love your work boys ;)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a6836761b6c9d88be564d40b728f0186be62a2d7","amp;dn":"Scott.And.Bailey.S01E06.720p.HDTV.x264-BiA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a6836761b6c9d88be564d40b728f0186be62a2d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,131,103,97,182,201,216,139,229,100,212,11,114,143,1,134,190,98,162,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
