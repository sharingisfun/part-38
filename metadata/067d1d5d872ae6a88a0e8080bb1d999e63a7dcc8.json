Quitting is not an option, so, with the benefit of a few-too-many drinks and some dubious advice from a hustling ex-con (Jamie Foxx), the three friends devise a convoluted and seemingly foolproof plan to rid themselves of their respective employers... permanently. There's only one problem: even the best laid plans are only as foolproof as the brains behind them. -- (C) Warner Bros\n\n\nR, 1 hr. 37 min.\n\nComedy\n\nDirected By:Seth Gordon\n\nWritten By:Michael Markowitz, John Francis Daley, Jonathan Goldstein\n\n\nIn Theaters: Jul 8, 2011 Wide\n\nOn DVD: Oct 11, 2011\n\nUS Box Office:$116.9M\n\nWarner Bros.
