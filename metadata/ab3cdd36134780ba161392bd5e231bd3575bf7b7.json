It wasn't until chess became a popular pastime for European royals during the Middle Ages that the queen was born and was gradually empowered to become the king's fierce warrior and protector.\n\nBirth of the Chess Queen examines the five centuries between the chess queen's timid emergence in the early days of the Holy Roman Empire to her elevation during the reign of Isabel of Castile. Marilyn Yalom, inspired by a handful of surviving medieval chess queens, traces their origin and spread from Spain, Italy, and Germany to France, England, Scandinavia, and Russia. In a lively and engaging historical investigation, Yalom draws parallels between the rise of the chess queen and the ascent of female sovereigns in Europe, presenting a layered, fascinating history of medieval courts and internal struggles for power.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Birth-Chess-Queen-Marilyn-Yalom/dp/0060090650/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1327096848&amp;sr=8-1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Birth-Chess-Queen-Marilyn-Yalom/dp/0060090650/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1327096848&amp;sr=8-1&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab3cdd36134780ba161392bd5e231bd3575bf7b7","amp;dn":"Birth+of+the+Chess+Queen%3A+A+History","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab3cdd36134780ba161392bd5e231bd3575bf7b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,60,221,54,19,71,128,186,22,19,146,189,94,35,27,211,87,91,247,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
