Ross is joined by two versions of the Gerry Mulligan Quartet with either Chet Baker or Art Farmer on trumpet, Bill Crow or Henry Grimes on bass, and drummer Dave Bailey. Annie Ross is at her best (and most appealing) on &quot;I've Grown Accustomed to Your Face,&quot; &quot;Give Me the Simple Life,&quot; &quot;How About You,&quot; and &quot;The Lady's in Love With You,&quot; but all the selections are quite rewarding and her interplay with baritonist Mulligan is consistently memorable.\n\n  ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd159543355809dc095c598959374ec80745f81a","amp;dn":"Annie+Ross+Sings+a+Song+With+Mulligan+Bonus+Track+Version","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd159543355809dc095c598959374ec80745f81a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,21,149,67,53,88,9,220,9,92,89,137,89,55,78,200,7,69,248,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
