WHO HAS REALLY BEEN CONTROLLING THIS PLANET?\n\n? WHY DOES EACH OF US SEEM TO HAVE LESS POWER THAN HE SHOULD?\n\n? WHY HAVE CERTAIN KEY EVENTS BEEN LEFT OUT OF THE HUMAN HISTORICAL RECORD?\n\n? HAS A FALSE LID BEEN PLACED ON HUMAN POTENTIAL?\n\n? WHY WE HAVE WE BEEN LIED TO ABOUT THE GENUINENESS OF PARANORMAL ABILITIES?\n\n? WHO OWNS 25% OF THE WORLD&amp;#039;S PRODUCTIVE CAPACITY, AND WHAT DOES THE CIA HAVE TO DO WITH THAT?\n\n? WHAT DO THE VATICAN, THE OLD USSR, THE NAZIS, THE CIA, AND THE GLOBAL CORPORATE ELITE REALLY HAVE IN COMMON?\n\n? HOW COULD A THRILLING NEW CIVILIZATION REALLY BE IN OUR GRASP?\n\n? HOW CAN EACH OF US TAKE GIANT EVOLUTIONARY STEPS?\n\nFor fifteen years, Jon Rappoport has presented millions of words on his radio programs, in his books and articles, and on television about the true conflicts between established monopoly and freedom. His investigations of the medical research establishment, the pharmaceutical cartels, and fraudulent political cover stories have ranged over subjects like AIDS, toxic chemicals and drugs, the Oklahoma City bombing, the CIA&amp;#039;s mind-control program, suppressed energy technologies, and alternative healing.\n\nA painter whose work is in many collections from California to Nigeria, a published poet, radio and television host, educator, former candidate for US Congress, Mr. Rappoport now moves to a new level with THE SECRET BEHIND SECRET SOCIETIES.\n\nTHE SECRET BEHIND SECRET SOCIETIES\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe way of the secret society is a way of life. At its root, it is not grinning skulls and sputtering candles in dark rooms. It is not that provincial.\n\nThe secret society reflects one invisible tradition that has existed on Earth for a hundred thousand years. It is the main Way that people have lived on this planet.\n\nThere is another way, another tradition, more invisible, more powerful.\n\nThis book is about these two avenues.\n\nIt is amazing, at this late date, that so many people think power is merely a cake of clay that six billion of us are beating at with hammers. It is astonishing that so many people think power is a mound of lumps and dust that six billion of us are fighting over.\n\nPower has been taken by very well-run organizations. Major power.\n\nOn the other side of the coin, there is a growing crowd that thinks we must invoke fire-eating lizards or Satan to explain how power has been stolen from us.\n\nThis is a book about the organizations that have carted off something very vital in the middle of the night - and how to get it back. More than that, it is about the exact methods used to unhook us from all that we are.\n\nI have done enough excavation to expose the central ruse, to show two invisible traditions of history.\n\nI have gotten into the shiny stainless steel vault in the big bank, looked around, and pointed out the obvious. And then after that I have refused to budge.\n\nI believe we are grappling, as if in a dream, with the layers of anesthetic that surround the core of our being.\n\nThis book is a search for ... what? A platform from which to view the place in ourselves which could revolutionize the future.\n\nThis search is not new, and we have all been over significant ground before. But we turn away, we demean ourselves, we fabricate existence and lessen its meaning. We pay allegiance to myths and gods, we accept a shrunken view of history.\n\nBut in history are veins of master substance, as it were, that can lead us back to ourselves in a new way.\n\nThe style of this book is not to set out, like file cabinets, a precise robot-march of facts which ultimately spell out a hypothesis. I rather take you along on my own adventure of discovery, because I want you to see and feel something, not merely make notes in the machine-part of the mind.\n\nThese days, the terms cult, secret society, and religion are all so loaded that their meanings are melting down.\n\nI use cult and secret society to mean: organized groups which harbor a hidden agenda whose purpose is to dominate and control others.\n\nThis agenda doesn?t rule out the existence of a merry public face. In fact, a cult may be doing good in one sphere while destroying life and limb on another front.\n\nIn this book, religion means a group which has a hierarchical power structure leading up to an invisible God. Naturally the God favors the religion which worships Him. Otherwise, why bother?\n\nMost religions are secret societies. They have an agenda which involves controlling their devotees, all their charity-work notwithstanding.\n\nHistorically, people seek out secret societies and religions and join them to gain freedom from pain and turmoil. People also join because they are forced to. For example, the country they live in leaves no choice. Such was the case in medieval Europe, where the Roman Catholic Church held the wand of dominance.\n\nBut there is another factor. The popular term for it these days is mind control. It used to be brainwashing, hypnotism. I will discuss that aspect at length, in an unusual way.\n\nWhen I use only the first name of a person, that name is fictitious. The reason is the same in all such cases: to ensure privacy. This book can offer much evidence to support its conclusions, but it cannot rest on absolute proof. Because of the nature of the subject, I have had to rely, in certain crucial situations, on the testimony of anonymous sources.\n\nI have also, as I say, chosen to rely on my personal experience, because the story that will now unfold is empty without it.\n\n================================================================================\nLearn the true nature of the world, come visit our huge dedicated e-library and forums @ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://conspiracycentral.net:6969/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://conspiracycentral.net:6969/index.html&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://conspiracycentral.info/index.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://conspiracycentral.info/index.php&lt;/a&gt;\n================================================================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db1d628abf73dba076fd4e5db48b58cc03727836","amp;dn":"Jon+Rappoport+-+The+Secret+Behind+Secret+Societies","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db1d628abf73dba076fd4e5db48b58cc03727836","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,29,98,138,191,115,219,160,118,253,78,93,180,139,88,204,3,114,120,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
