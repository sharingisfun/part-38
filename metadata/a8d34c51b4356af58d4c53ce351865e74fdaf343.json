At least he acknowledged that\n itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tough to be a Republican in HollywoodÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ What if we had a Republican President and suffered through this\n economy and these setbacks in the Middle East? What storylines would the press be pushing then?Ã¢â‚¬Â¦\n Despite the tide of Ã¢â‚¬Å“bad news,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Romney supporters have reason for cautious optimism.\n\n\n\nPrager 20120924 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2 Bill Kristol\n\nPrager H2: Dennis talks to Bill Kristol, editor of The Weekly Standard, about the state of the electionÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ \n The President and Mitt Romney were on Ã¢â‚¬Å“60 MinutesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ last night. The way each talked about Israel was very\n instructive.\n\n\n\nPrager 20120924 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 1 Early Voting\n\nPrager H1: When did this early voting fad start? We have made it too easy to vote. But ask for an ID, \n as every country does in Europe, and youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re advocating Ã¢â‚¬Å“Voter Suppression.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ \n Our quick exit from Iraq has been devastating both to that country and to our interests there and\n the Middle East. Have we once again snatched defeat from the jaws of victory?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                  Download, seed, and spread the word. \n\n\nMore Stuff is here\nRush, Michael Savage, Mark Levin, Dennis Prager\nthepiratebay . se / user / CAPTAIN7SS/0/3\nbeta . demonoid . me / files / ?seeded=2&amp;uid=7492662\n\nRush Shows and Neal Boortz Shows Live are here\nthepiratebay . se / user / amuck5 /\n\nLaura Ingraham podcasts are here\nthepiratebay . se / user / freedomczar /\n\nGlenn Beck Insider podcasts are here\nthepiratebay . se / search / glenn%20beck/0/99/100\n\nPodcasts of the Rush Limbaugh Show are here (temporarily stopped uploading)\nthepiratebay . se / user / Annoyme /\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8d34c51b4356af58d4c53ce351865e74fdaf343","amp;dn":"The+Dennis+Prager+Radio+Show+SEP-24-2012+MON","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a8d34c51b4356af58d4c53ce351865e74fdaf343","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,211,76,81,180,53,106,245,141,76,83,206,53,24,101,231,79,218,243,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
