It is a textbook on quantum theory intended for advanced undergraduate or graduate students: mathematics students interested in modern physics, and physics students who are interested in the mathematical background of physics and are dissatisfied with the level of rigor in standard physics courses. More generally, it offers a valuable resource for all mathematicians interested in modern physics, and all physicists looking for a higher degree of mathematical precision with regard to the basic concepts in their field","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f53f10e72c6167457eba5962e4f3ee28c8a325de","amp;dn":"Quantum+Theory%3A+A+Mathematical+Approach+%5B2015%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f53f10e72c6167457eba5962e4f3ee28c8a325de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,63,16,231,44,97,103,69,126,186,89,98,228,243,238,40,200,163,37,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
