My Favorite Things was destined to be the most remembered and influential of these, and while Coltrane Plays the Blues is not as renowned or daring in material, it is still a powerful session. As for the phrase &quot;plays the blues&quot; in the title, that's not so much an indicator that the tunes are conventional blues (which they aren't). It's more indicative of a bluesy sensibility, whether he is playing muscular saxophone or, on &quot;Blues to Bechet&quot; and &quot;Mr. Syms,&quot; the more unusual-sounding (at the time) soprano sax. Elvin Jones, who hadn't been in Coltrane's band long, really busts out on the quicker numbers, such as &quot;Blues to You&quot; and &quot;Mr. Day.&quot; The 2000 reissue on Rhino adds five bonus tracks: two alternates apiece of &quot;Blues to Elvin&quot; and &quot;Blues to You&quot; (which were originally released on the 1995 Heavyweight Champion: The Complete Atlantic Recordings box), and &quot;Untitled Original (Exotica).&quot; This last track first appeared on the 1970 compilation The Coltrane Legacy and, like every other one on this CD, was recorded on October 24, 1960. \n \n\n\n\n       1  Blues to Elvin  Jones  7:52  \n       2  Blues to Bechet  Coltrane  5:46  \n       3  Blues to You  Coltrane  6:30  \n       4  Mr. Day  Coltrane  7:55  \n       5  Mr. Syms  Coltrane  5:22  \n       6  Mr. Knight  Coltrane  7:39  \n       7  Untitled Original  Coltrane  5:25  \n  \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b64435aabd2e37397cc64221e3e197ccb2bfe6fd","amp;dn":"JAZZ+-+Coltrane+Plays+The+Blues%28320+kps%29105+mb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b64435aabd2e37397cc64221e3e197ccb2bfe6fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,68,53,170,189,46,55,57,124,198,66,33,227,225,151,204,178,191,230,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
