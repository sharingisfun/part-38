As per usual, I didn't see a collected torrent for this week's Marvel NOW! titles yet, so I thought I'd upload one. \nIncluded are:\n\n\nA+X #17\nAMAZING X-MEN #4\nAVENGERS WORLD #3\nCAPTAIN AMERICA #17\nDAREDEVIL #36\nIRON MAN ANNUAL #1\nNEW WARRIORS #1\nNOVA #13.NOW\nPUNISHER #2\nSAVAGE WOLVERINE #15\nSUPERIOR SPIDER-MAN TEAM-UP #10\nUNCANNY X-MEN #17\nX-MEN #11\n\n\nIf you like them and have the money, BUY THEM and support your favorite creators, writers, artists, local comic shops and publishers. \n\nSeriously, buy the comics you have money for. But only the ones you think deserve your money-- vote with your dollars, and also make your voices heard. Marvel has a pretty good internet presence, which also means they read emails, tweets, tumblr responses, facebook comments. They've shown that they are solely focused on sales numbers-- vote with yr money, and tell them with words (not curses). They WILL listen, eventually. You know-- the internets.\n\nAll my thanks to all the uploaders and scanners and seeders out there! Enjoy! (and seed!)\n\nPersonal commentary of the week: Sorry for the late upload, friends, I was holding out for Revolutionary War: Super Soldiers, but I can't find it anywhere. WTFFFFFFF. I'll include it with the next release, whenever it does get released.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41ca2709530404ebbab6b3aa4c090b2d886a32f8","amp;dn":"Marvel+NOW%21+Week+66%2FAll-New+Marvel+NOW%21+Week+9+02%2F19%2F2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41ca2709530404ebbab6b3aa4c090b2d886a32f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,202,39,9,83,4,4,235,186,182,179,170,76,9,11,45,136,106,50,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
