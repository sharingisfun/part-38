The book analyses the complex network of interdependencies that exist between companies and which determine their characteristics. It fully analyses the process of interaction through which companies and networks evolve and are transformed. Specifically, the book thoroughly examines the following:\n\n    * The dynamics and interrelatedness of the business landscape\n    * Interaction as the basic business process\n    * Business development in time and network space\n    * The nature of management in an interactive world\n    * The implications for policyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“makers of the networked business landscape \n\nThis book is essential reading for all those interested in understanding the complex business world. This includes academics and their students taking advanced courses on managing in business networks at MSc, MBA and executive education level, managers operating in business companies, and those involved in industrial policy.\n\nThe authors are central researchers within the international IMP (Industrial Marketing and Purchasing) Group (impgroup.org).
