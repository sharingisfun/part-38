I will release a Volume 2 once I manage to dig up more, which is very likely. If you prefer to use an OS port, I would highly suggest either GZDoom or Zandronum. GZDoom has a more up-to-date version of OpenGL, but Zandronum offers online play. Enjoy, and play Brutal Doom while you're at it :P\n\n\n&gt;&gt; GZDoom Instructions &lt;&lt;\n\n1.) Unzip you desired megawad, and drag &amp; drop it onto the GZDoom icon.\n2.) Select either Doom or Doom 2 in the menu, depending on which game the wad was made for.\n\n&gt;&gt; Zandronum Instructions &lt;&lt;\n\n1.) Inside the Zandronum folder, create a folder called &quot;skins&quot;.\n2.) Unzip the desired megawad, and place it inside the 'skins' folder.&quot;\n3.) Click on the zandronum icon, and select either Doom or Doom 2 in the menu, depending on which game the wad was designed for.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:297d3fa797e582d71742faa41600df42ad049d78","amp;dn":"Doom+Megawads+Vol.1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"297d3fa797e582d71742faa41600df42ad049d78","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,125,63,167,151,229,130,215,23,66,250,164,22,0,223,66,173,4,157,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
