They are our past, our present and \n       our future. They define and identify us and, as we all know from \n       personal experience, are hugely complicated.\n       \n       The Deeble family is no exception. In this moving film, we follow \n       as, over the course of one extraordinary weekend, they come \n       together to confront and bury the ghosts of a past that has \n       haunted all of them.\n       \n       Like many others during the 1950s and early 1960s, Reginald Deeble \n       came to the UK from the West Indies in search of a better life for \n       his young family. But sadly, not long after settling in Port Talbot \n       in South Wales, tragedy struck when Reginald's wife died leaving \n       him to care for their five children.\n       \n       Unable to cope alone, Reginald was forced to take drastic action. \n       He had a photograph taken of the family, dressed up in their Sunday \n       best, and sent it home to Jamaica with the aim of attracting a \n       surrogate mother for his children. Months later 'Aunt' Nomi arrived \n       on the doorstep and their lives and family would never the same \n       again.\n       \n       For nearly four decades Linda, Ishmael, Lloyd, Selina and Derek \n       have buried their feelings about 'Aunt' Nomi and the dramatic \n       impact she had on their family. Now, for the first time, all five \n       Deeble children, surrounded by husbands, wives, children and \n       grandchildren, are coming together to share the painful memories of \n       childhood and finally face up to what happened to them all those \n       years ago.\n       \n       It is a weekend of extreme highs and desperate lows. But even if \n       the siblings can come to terms with their difficult past, will it \n       be enough to bring the family back together? Can this reunion kick-\n       start a process of reconciliation that will bring the Deebles \n       closer than they've ever been?\n\n\n                             Big up all scene massive!\n\n\n    \n                                       \n                GROUP  INFORMATION          \n         9 Years of the Force and still    \n                      going strong                  \n     \n\n           What we are looking for:\n\n           * gigabit euro sites for x264 only\n           * 100mbit or gigabit archive sites for TV/XVID/ETC\n           * 1080p or 720p rippers pre retail or classics\n           * Fios cappers in u.s\n           * U.K or Pre Retail Dvdrippers\n           * Internal 100mbit 1tb+ dump sites for Exlusive group usage\n           * If you think you can help contact us on irc\n           * or email us at &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;22644d504147624a57514a0c434b&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:616cca4bdbda681783f937dccad4063caf37c3ac","amp;dn":"We.Are.Family.S01E02.WS.PDTV.XviD-aAF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"616cca4bdbda681783f937dccad4063caf37c3ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,108,202,75,219,218,104,23,131,249,55,220,202,212,6,60,175,55,195,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
