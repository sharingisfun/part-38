By 1962\nwhen brothers George and Ernie Leaner started One-\nderful! Records, they were revered figures on\nChicago's Record Row and beyond. They distributed\nmaterial from labels like Motown and Stax and One-\nderful! attracted top talent. It wasn't uncommon for a\nWVON DJ to help One-derful! sign their newest\ndiscovery, or for their singers, musicians,\nsongwriters, or producers to have Chess or Motown on\ntheir resumes. Nearly 20 years prior, George and Ernie\nstarted work at their sister's Groove Record Shop.\nBefore long, George was an assistant to legendary\nblues producer Lester Melrose, and later the brothers\nhelped run Parkway Records - recording historic 78s\nfeaturing Little Walter and Muddy Waters. They did all\nof this before launching United Record Distributors in\n1950 - regarded as the nation's first black owned\nrecord distributor. In addition, their uncle Al Benson\nwas the most influential Radio DJ on Chicago's South\nSide. His on-air support and occasional partnerships\nwith the Chess brothers proved crucial to their early\nsuccess. He also helped many DJs get their start,\nincluding Vivian Carter who later formed Vee-Jay\nRecords. In fact, United Record Distributors hosted\nher wedding. The Leaner name also turns up in\nconnection with many of the greats in blues and soul:\nGeorge Leaner produced an early release for Berry\nGordy's Tamla label, and in the 1970s Ernie Leaner and\nStax's Al Bell partnered to form Ernie's Onestop and a\nchain of Record World stores. The Leaner family were\namong the most important black businessmen of music's\ngolden era, yet much of their history has only been\nsuperficially documented until now.\n\nBetween 1962 and 1971, the One-derful! family of\nlabels released 180+ 45s of stunning soul, funk, and\ngospel. Over two years of painstaking research and\nwork, including countless hours spent cataloging,\ntransferring, and mastering 250 of the label's tapes,\nhas contributed to an amazingly extensive reissue\ncollection. In addition, some of the world's leading\nexperts have contributed liner notes and interviewed\nvirtually every known surviving artist, producer, and\notherwise involved party. In total, the six volumes of\nthe One-derful! Collection include 12 LPs/6 CDs with\n147 tracks, 57 which were never issued, and 144 pages\nof 12&quot; x 12&quot; liner notes stuffed full of rare and\nnever before seen photos and memorabilia. Spanning\n1962 to 1971, these compilations bring forth a wealth\nof overlooked and never before heard recordings and\nhistory.\n\nUnreleased tracks:\n\n1,4,6,8,10,11,12,16,18,20,21,24.\n\nd a t a\n\n#    t r a c k  n a m e                         t i m e\n\n01-  Otis Clay - Got to Find a Way (Alternate)  [02:34]\n02-  The Sharpees - The Sock                    [02:25]\n03-  Joe and Mack - The Prettiest Girl          [02:40]\n04-  The Five Du-Tones - When You Get That      [02:37]\n     Feeling\n05-  Lucky Laws - Who Is She                    [02:30]\n06-  McKinley Mitchell - What Love Will Make    [02:32]\n     You Do\n07-  Betty Everett - Please Love Me             [02:28]\n08-  The Sharpees - Take Me To Your Leader      [02:42]\n09-  The Rockmasters - A Wonderful Thing (Love) [02:44]\n10-  Mary Silvers - Here Comes My Baby          [02:40]\n11-  Beverly Shaffer - Meet Me Halfway          [02:08]\n12-  Liz Lands - Seventh Hour                   [02:55]\n13-  The Admirations - All For You              [02:53]\n14-  The Five Du-Tones - Shake A Tail Feather   [02:25]\n15-  The Sharpees - Do The 45&quot;                  [03:18]\n16-  Otis Clay - Thank You Love                 [02:12]\n17-  McKinley Mitchell - The Town I Live In     [02:49]\n18-  Liz Lands - I'm Guilty                     [02:50]\n19-  Betty Everett - Your Love is Important to  [03:07]\n\n20-  The Five Du-Tones - Enjoy Yourself         [02:54]\n21-  McKinley Mitchell - Now That You're Gone   [02:44]\n22-  Jay Jordan - The Man of the Town           [02:28]\n23-  The Admirations - Don't Leave Me           [02:37]\n24-  Beverly Shaffer - Happy Times              [02:37]\n25-  Otis Clay - A Lasting Love                 [02:50]\n\n73,4 m e g s                   t o t a l  [66:39]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:67799e61bbc749c6d8b6ab41b3081fd0a97bc59f","amp;dn":"VA-The_One-Derful_Collection_Vol_1_One-Derful_Records-2014-CMS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"67799e61bbc749c6d8b6ab41b3081fd0a97bc59f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,121,158,97,187,199,73,198,216,182,171,65,179,8,31,208,169,123,197,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
