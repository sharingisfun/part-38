Create unique\n  Compression and Destination settings, and assign them\n  to a Droplet. Dragging files and folders to that\n  Droplet will create an archive using the settings from\n  the Profile you specified. You can make as many unique\n  Droplets as you wish. Also, you can use Droplets even\n  if StuffIt is not already running, just save your Droplet\n  to the Desktop, or any convenient place on your system and\n  then drag files and folders to the Droplet icon anytime.\n  StuffIt will process the files without launching the full\n  StuffIt application.\n\n- Contextual Menu enhancements:\n\n  Recent and most-used commands now appear at the top-level\n  of the StuffIt Contextual Menu for quick access.\n\n  You can now Schedule backups right from the StuffIt\n  Contextual Menu\n\n- StuffIt's User Interface has been modified and simplified\n  to make it easy to use.\n\n  StuffIt's Start Page now provides easy access to all of\n  the Wizards and Tools as well as Tutorials and News from\n  Smith Micro.\n\n  StuffIt's Quick Tools page provides Drag-and-Drop targets\n  for easy archive creation, expansion, or browsing.\n\n  StuffIt's Archive Manager page now presents more archive\n  types.\n\n- Encoded archives (ie: foo.zip.uu) are now browsable\n\n- Support for more formats:\n\n  Expansion support for 7z (ie: foo.7z)\n\n  Expansion support for LZMA (ie: foo.lzma)\n\n  Expansion support for segmented Zip (ie: foo.zip, foo.z01,\n  foo.z02, etc.)\n\n  Expansion support for split archives (ie: foo.rar.001,\n  foo.rar.002, etc.)\n\n- Major SEA Builder enhancements including:\n\n  Make smaller SEAs by storing the Payload on a Remote FTP\n  server\n\n- StuffIt Plugins for Adobe Photoshop now support CS4.\n\n\n\nHow to install in 5 easy steps:\n===============================\n\n1. Install the application as usual but do not\n   fill any info, just skip by clicking &quot;Next&quot;\n   if asked.\n\n2. Open Task Manager and kill the process named\n   &quot;ArcNameService.exe&quot;.\n\n3. Copy common.dll and ArcNameService.exe from\n   the crack folder to the installation folder\n   (usually Program FilesSmithMicroStuffIt)\n\n4. Double-click click_me_1.reg and click_me_2.reg\n   files located in the crack folder.\n\n5. That's it! Enjoy!\n\n\n\nNote #1:\n========\n\nArcNameService.exe is an archive indexing feature\nwhich is in my personal opinion useless.\n\nIf you want to keep it, then you should not copy\nArcNameService.exe from the crack folder and you\nshould not double-click on click_me_2.reg.\n\n\n\nNote #2:\n========\n\nFile StuffIt13.0.0.19.msi has been processed to\nadd DISABLEADVTSHORTCUTS property and to set\nAgreeToLicense property to &quot;Yes&quot; by default for\nyour convenience.\n\nIf you are comparing it to the original installer\nthat is why it differs a bit.\n\nFile Common.dll has been patched to enable Deluxe\nversion functionality without requiring serial and\nwithout expiring.\n\nFile ArcNameService.exe has been patched so it does\nnot start because that service annoys me.\n\nSince those files are digitally signed, some virus\nscanners may notice that the signature does not match\nbut don't get alarmed -- my files are always clean.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e68646f37587d0c7a3f832d8fc8e0df0c757653a","amp;dn":"StuffIt+Deluxe%C3%82%C2%AE+2009+%2813.0.0.19%29+for+Windows+by+hk-47","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e68646f37587d0c7a3f832d8fc8e0df0c757653a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,134,70,243,117,135,208,199,163,248,50,216,252,142,13,240,199,87,101,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
