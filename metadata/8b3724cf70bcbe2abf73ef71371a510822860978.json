The premise of the show is that Brewer and China are on a mission to save repairable enthusiast vehicles, by repairing or otherwise improving an example of a particular make and model to a budget, then selling it to a new owner. While Edd spends large amounts of time repairing each car, that time is not taken into account in determining how much was spent on the car and whether any profit was made.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b3724cf70bcbe2abf73ef71371a510822860978","amp;dn":"Wheeler+Dealers+Season+11+Episode+1-5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b3724cf70bcbe2abf73ef71371a510822860978","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,55,36,207,112,188,190,42,191,115,239,113,55,26,81,8,34,134,9,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
