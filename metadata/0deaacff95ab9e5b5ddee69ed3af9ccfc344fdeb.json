It is very dynamic \r\nand atmospheric and is thus generally more enjoyable \r\nthan the soundboard\r\n\r\nSoundboard Source: \r\nIncomplete excellent soundboard recording.\r\nDetails: \r\nThe recording is a very good balanced professional \r\nboard tape that favors bass and drums.\r\n\r\nTracklist:\r\n\r\nCD 1\r\n1. Rock And Roll\r\n2. Celebration Day\r\n3. Black Dog\r\n4. Over The Hills And Far Away\r\n5. Misty Mountain Hop  \r\n6. Since I've Been Loving You\t\r\n7. No Quarter\r\n8. The Song Remains the Same\r\n9. The Rain Song (cut)\r\n\r\nCD 2 \r\n1. Dazed And Confused\r\n2. Stairway To Heaven\r\n3. Moby Dick (cut)\r\n\r\nCD 3\r\n1. Heartbreaker\r\n2. Whole Lotta Love (medley)\r\n3. Communication Breakdown\r\n\r\nComments: \r\nIf the previous show was nirvana, this one is beyond that. An excellent\r\nshow with rowdy audience that caused the reaction from the side of the \r\nauthorities. &quot;We've got to get these house lights down. It's pretty \r\npointless us bringing our own lights, if we've got these things going \r\non. Mr Cole, can you take your dress off and get these lights turned \r\ndown please?&quot; asked Plant in rather humorously mood. His voice is \r\ncracking and breaking all over the place, but the band is playing \r\nexceptionally well, and from Dazed And Confused on, this show reaches \r\nits peak. Dazed has a unique, very dark and thrilling bow solo and \r\nHeartbreaker, Whole Lotta Love and the encore are gutsy and raw and \r\nRobert has recovered. John Bonham was introduced as the Drag Queen of \r\nNew Orleans","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0deaacff95ab9e5b5ddee69ed3af9ccfc344fdeb","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+-+1973.05.14+New+Orleans%2C+Louisiana+MP3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0deaacff95ab9e5b5ddee69ed3af9ccfc344fdeb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,234,172,255,149,171,158,91,93,222,230,158,211,175,156,207,195,68,253,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
