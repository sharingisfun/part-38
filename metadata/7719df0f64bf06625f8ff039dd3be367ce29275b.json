The South Australian Museum focuses on enhancing a general knowledge of this extraordinary legacy by encouraging photography of the regionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nature and wilderness, and promoting an annual competition to find the Nature Photographer of the Year.\n\nAustralasian Nature Photography: ANZANG Ninth Collection presents the finest photographs submitted to the competition. Each photograph is accompanied by technical information as well as anecdotes about how the picture was taken, which will stimulate yet further interest in the flora and fauna and their conservation in the region.\n\nGenre: Non-Fiction / General | Photography ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7719df0f64bf06625f8ff039dd3be367ce29275b","amp;dn":"Australasian+Nature+Photography+By+South+Australian+Museum","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7719df0f64bf06625f8ff039dd3be367ce29275b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,25,223,15,100,191,6,98,95,143,240,57,221,59,227,103,206,41,39,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
