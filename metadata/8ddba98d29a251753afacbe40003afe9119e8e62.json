Now, in this unique and timely book, he proposes that Catholicism is not a lifeless set of rules and regulations , but a way of life designed by God to help each person reach his or her full potential. With remarkable insight, Kelly dispels dozens of myths that surround the rejection of Catholicism today and provides a profound and practical vision of what will lead the Catholic Church to thrive again in the future. Rediscover Catholicism is quickly becoming the most read catholic book of our times. From the spellbinding opening story, Kelly grips his readers and takes them on a life-changing journey to rediscover the genius of Catholicism.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ddba98d29a251753afacbe40003afe9119e8e62","amp;dn":"Rediscover.Catholicism","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ddba98d29a251753afacbe40003afe9119e8e62","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,219,169,141,41,162,81,117,58,250,203,228,0,3,175,233,17,158,142,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
