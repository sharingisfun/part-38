I downloaded a series of large files\nthat included all of her albums from 1990 through 2010 and they were\nterrible.  All blues music done in the style of the 1930s / 40s -- the kind of\nmusic our grandparents listened to! I think people in their 80s and up might\nbe her market these days. There was some blues-rock but very little.\n\nIt's too bad Dana didn't stick with rock music, because she certainly had\nthe voice for it! Not so much in recent years though, as her voice\ngot much deeper.  This album was co-produced by Bowie guitarist Mick Ronson.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c6b20e3d06009d4f18c6ba03b22594ff30a03006","amp;dn":"DANA+GILLESPIE+--+Werent+Born+A+Man+%28+produced+by+David+Bowie+%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c6b20e3d06009d4f18c6ba03b22594ff30a03006","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,178,14,61,6,0,157,79,24,198,186,3,178,37,148,255,48,160,48,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
