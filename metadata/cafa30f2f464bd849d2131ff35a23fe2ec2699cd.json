Meanwhile, Beast and Logan are at Neuron's mercy, while Marsh restrains Emma, Yui, and Hisako. Hisako remembers that Takeo was her childhood friend at the mutant school, but she was accidentally injured when his powers manifested (resulting in the pain in her hand). Takeo's guilt caused him to erase himself from everyone's memories. Yui shut down the school to care for him and seek a means to subdue his powers. Meanwhile, Logan devises a plan to have Beast overload his sensory input until he goes into a berserker rage where he feels no pain, neutralizing Nueron's powers. Woverine kills Neuron and regains his senses. Hisako and Cyclops are able to defeat Marsh, but Mastermind entraps Cyclops in a nightmarish illusion about his inability to kill Dark Phoenix. \nHowever, he manages to break free of the illusion due to the intervention of Jean Grey, who helps him realize that his true regret was his inability to free her of her suffering as Dark Phoenix by killing her when she begged him to. The X-Men face Mastermind, but he is killed by Takeo as his powers run out of control and Takeo transforms into a colossal energy being capable of destroying the world and shattering reality. Professor X arrives from the Blackbird in time to confront his son alongside the X-Men.  \n\nSpoken Language:- English\n\n=============================\n\nScreenshots\n-----------\n\n[URL=http://img209.imageshack.us/i/xmen111revengeendojavit.jpg/][IMG]http://img209.imageshack.us/img209/5668/xmen111revengeendojavit.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n================================\n\nFile Info\n----------\n\n              ===== File Info ===== \nFileSize           : 175M\nPlayTime           : 00:18:57.771\nVideoCount         : 1\nAudioCount         : 1\n              ===== Video Info ===== \nVideo 0# Stream\nVideoCodec         : XVID\nVideoWidth         : 720 piexs\nVideoHeight        : 420 piexs\nVideoFrameRate     : 29.970fps\nVideoFrameCount    : 34099\nVideoBitRate       : 1155499\n              ===== Audio Info ===== \nAudio 0# Stream\nAudioCodec         : MP3\nAudioBitRate       : 128000\nAudioChannels      : 2\nAudioSampleRate    : 44100\n\n\nFormat:- AVI\n\n=============================\n\nHash\n-----\nCAFA30F2F464BD849D2131FF35A23FE2EC2699CD\n[/center]\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cafa30f2f464bd849d2131ff35a23fe2ec2699cd","amp;dn":"X-Men+-+111+-+Revenge+%7E+End+%5BOj%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cafa30f2f464bd849d2131ff35a23fe2ec2699cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,250,48,242,244,100,189,132,157,33,49,255,53,162,63,226,236,38,153,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
