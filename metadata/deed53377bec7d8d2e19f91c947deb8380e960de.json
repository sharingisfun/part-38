Much of the music on Ki-Oku flirts with smooth-groove jazz -- Kondo's muted trumpet line on &quot;Mu-Getsu&quot; sounds an awful lot like something Chris Botti would play, while the duo's instrumental take on the Bob Marley classic &quot;Sun Is Shining&quot; comes off just a little bit muzak-y. On the other hand, &quot;Ki-Gen&quot; and &quot;Ko-Ku&quot; both find Kondo using synthesized treatments in a way that evokes Jon Hassell's work with Brian Eno, while on the latter DJ Krush layers slightly menacing keyboard washes beneath Kondo's unassuming trumpet lines. This is one of those albums that reveals more with repeated listens; if it sounds too easy at first, listen again -- there's lots of interesting stuff going on beneath what sometimes sounds like a merely pleasant surface.\n\n\nEnjoy - Smoaky","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:deed53377bec7d8d2e19f91c947deb8380e960de","amp;dn":"dj+krush+%26+toshinori+kondo+-+KI-OKU","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"deed53377bec7d8d2e19f91c947deb8380e960de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,237,83,55,123,236,125,141,46,25,249,28,148,125,235,131,128,233,96,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
