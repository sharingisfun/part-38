Miami Sound Machine)\n\nRelease Notes:\n\nAs one of the biggest new stars to emerge during the\nmid-&amp;#039;80s, singer Gloria Estefan predated the coming\nLatin pop explosion by a decade, scoring a series of\npropulsive dance hits rooted in the rhythms of her\nnative Cuba before shifting her focus to softer,\nmore ballad-oriented fare. Born Gloria Fajardo in\nHavana on September 1, 1957, she was raised\nprimarily in Miami, FL, after her father, a\nbodyguard in the employ of Cuban president Fulgencio\nBatista, was forced to flee the island following the\n1959 coup helmed by Fidel Castro. In the fall of\n1975, Fajardo and her cousin Merci Murciano\nauditioned for the Miami Latin Boys, a local wedding\nband headed by keyboardist Emilio Estefan. With\ntheir addition, the group was rechristened Miami\nSound Machine and four years later, Fajardo and\nEstefan were wed. As Miami Sound Machine began\ncomposing their own original material, their fusion\nof pop, disco, and salsa earned a devoted local\nfollowing, and in 1979 the group issued their first\nSpanish-language LP on CBS International. Despite a\ngrowing Hispanic fan base, they did not cross over\nto non-Latin audiences until &quot;Dr. Beat&quot; topped\nEuropean dance charts in 1984.\n\nWith 1985&amp;#039;s Primitive Love, Miami Sound Machine\nrecorded their first English-language effort,\nscoring three Top Ten pop hits in the U.S. alone\nwith the infectious &quot;Conga,&quot; &quot;Bad Boy,&quot; and &quot;Words\nGet in the Way.&quot; For 1988&amp;#039;s triple-platinum Let It\nLoose, the group was billed as Gloria Estefan &amp;\nMiami Sound Machine, reeling off four Top Ten hits\n-- &quot;Rhythm Is Gonna Get You,&quot; &quot;Can&amp;#039;t Stay Away from\nYou,&quot; the chart-topping &quot;Anything for You,&quot; and\n&quot;1-2-3.&quot; 1989&amp;#039;s Cuts Both Ways was credited to\nEstefan alone and generated her second number one\nhit, &quot;Don&amp;#039;t Wanna Lose You&quot;; however, while touring\nin support of the album, on March 20, 1990, her bus\nwas struck by a tractor trailer. She suffered a\nbroken vertebrae that required extensive surgery and\nkept her off the road for over a year. Emilio\nEstefan and the couple&amp;#039;s son were injured in the\ncrash as well, but all three recovered. Estefan\nresurfaced in 1991 with Into the Light, again\ntopping the charts with &quot;Coming Out of the Dark,&quot; a\nsingle inspired by her near-fatal accident; two more\ncuts from the album, &quot;Can&amp;#039;t Forget You&quot; and &quot;Live\nfor Loving You,&quot; secured her foothold on the adult\ncontemporary charts.\n\nWith 1993&amp;#039;s Mi Tierra, Estefan returned to her\nroots, recording her first Spanish-language record\nin close to a decade and earning a Grammy Award for\nBest Tropical Latin Album; on the follow-up, 1994&amp;#039;s\ncovers collection Hold Me Thrill Me Kiss Me, she\nalso recalled her dance-pop origins with a rendition\nof the Vicki Sue Robinson disco classic &quot;Turn the\nBeat Around.&quot; Another all-Spanish effort, Abriendo\nPuertas, earned the Grammy as well, while Destiny\nfeatured &quot;Reach,&quot; named the official theme of the\n1996 Summer Olympics. As Latin pop made new\ncommercial headway thanks to the efforts of acts\nlike Ricky Martin and Enrique Iglesias, Estefan\nreigned as the most successful crossover artist in\nLatin music history, with international record sales\nclose to the 50 million mark. In 1999, she also made\nher feature film debut alongside Meryl Streep in\nMusic of the Heart, recording the film&amp;#039;s title song\nas a duet with *NSYNC and scoring both a massive pop\nhit and an Oscar nomination in the process. A new\nSpanish-language album, Alma CaribeÃƒÂ±a, followed in\nthe spring of 2000. Several months later, Estefan\nwas awarded a Grammy for Best Music Video for &quot;No Me\nDehes de Querer&quot; at the first annual Latin Grammy\nAwards. Her husband, Emilio, won for Producer of the\nYear.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c65821b05aa709e88b4ba54d44fad9e83ce48c7","amp;dn":"Gloria+Estefan+-+The+Very+Best+Of+%282006%29+-+Pop","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c65821b05aa709e88b4ba54d44fad9e83ce48c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,101,130,27,5,170,112,158,136,180,186,84,212,79,173,158,131,206,72,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
