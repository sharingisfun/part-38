The music for this movie was made by a very cool collaboration between ex-Hooverphonic singer Geike Arnaert (Belgium) and Spinvis' Erik De Jong (Holland).\n\nSince they were very enthusastic about the music they created, they decided to put it on a record and brand it as &quot;DorlÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©ac&quot;.\n\nToday, I bring you a selection of half of the songs on their CD:\n\n01 - Dying in Silence\n03 - Backwards\n05 - Lemon Pie\n07 - Aerosol\n09 - Disparu\n\n\nI did not upload the entire album because I feel that sharing music is all about &quot;getting to know&quot; music and then supporting the artist by buying the music on CD.\n\nEspecially in this case, the composers' label is sure worth supporting because it is very much unlike the big bastard labels.\n\nSo if you like this, let's call it preview, then please support this band and the projects of Excelsior Recordings by buying the album at this location: http://www.excelsiorshop.nl/index.php?route=product/product&amp;product_id=240\n\n\nEnjoy the music!\n\n\nFinest regards,\n\n\nWover","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b518a686a0b6ca5d1208f18ad0e25c73fd5f9490","amp;dn":"Dorleac+-+Dorleac+%28Promo%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b518a686a0b6ca5d1208f18ad0e25c73fd5f9490","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,24,166,134,160,182,202,93,18,8,241,138,208,226,92,115,253,95,148,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
