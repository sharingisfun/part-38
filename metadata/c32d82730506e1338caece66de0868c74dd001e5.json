Disc 1 is a rollercoaster ride of entertainment, from great peaks of garage bliss to barren lows of wannabe-Stones and Kinks. All the selections from Holland and Denmark are here, with the latter half hailing solely from Sweden. Disc 2 kicks off with Swedish freakbeat before taking the train to Germany and finishing the tour in Switzerland.\n\nTracklist:\n\nDisc 1\n01. Rob Hoeke - When People Talk - 2:49\n02.
