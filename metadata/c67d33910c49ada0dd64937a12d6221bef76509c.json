It's not a big deal, E! just made shit confusing for everyone. \n\nBut uploader is following the right format for HIM. He is not scene. I see nothing wrong with his labels, and on top of that he takes the time to explain it to every single person that questions it...EVERY TIME HE UPLOADS AN EPISODE.\n\nTY atndigcrk for having these episodes up the fastest! I appreciate very much!&quot;&quot;\n\nSUPER FAST DOWNLOAD AS ALWAYS - STAY BACK FROM THE MONITOR HELPS ALOT ON PLAYBACK","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c67d33910c49ada0dd64937a12d6221bef76509c","amp;dn":"Kourtney+And+Kim+Take+New+York+S04E09+%28SUPER+NEW%21%21%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c67d33910c49ada0dd64937a12d6221bef76509c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,125,51,145,12,73,173,160,221,100,147,122,18,214,34,27,239,118,80,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
