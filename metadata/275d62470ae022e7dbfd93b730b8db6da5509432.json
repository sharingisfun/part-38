These men, for the most part illiterate sharecroppers from one of the poorest counties in Alabama, were never told what disease they were suffering from or of its seriousness. Informed that they were being treated for ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œbad blood,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ their doctors had no intention of curing them of syphilis at all.  The data for the experiment was to be collected from autopsies of the men, and they were thus deliberately left to degenerate under the ravages of tertiary syphilisÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½which can include tumors, heart disease, paralysis, blindness, insanity, and death. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAs I see it,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ one of the doctors involved explained, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œwe have no further interest in these patients until they die.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½This program, hosted by CBS News correspondent Richard Schlesinger, includes an interview with one of the last surviving participants, Herman Shaw; explains the role of Nurse Rivers; and presents the medical establishment's justification for disguising racism as legitimate medical research.&quot; Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Âº\n\n\nA nearly extinct relic of Nova's earlier, more journalistically daring days (well before ExxonMobile became a main underwriter), The Deadly Deception was once a documentary screened in high schools throughout the country.  It may be still, although its internet presence is certainly not consistent with that of a former staple of the US History class' documentary diet.  The title is unlisted at the WGBH website; the sales outlet for all Nova productions.  Upon navigating to the &quot;Archive&quot; link on the Nova main page one discovers that only episodes aired from 1996-present have been cataloged.  Browsing alphabetically under 'D' or 'T' is equally fruitless.  The only reference to the film anywhere within the entirety of PBS' webspace is inside an un-linked alternate archive Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¹, which begins with the notice:\n\n&quot;Please note that these listings are provided for informational purposes only; very few of these programs are available for purchase on video. Those that are can be found at the NOVA section of Shop WGBH.&quot;\n\nThe film is listed as either out of stock or unavailable at amazon.com, buy.com, ecampus.com and extramovie.com, though it is possible to check out a worn VHS copy from many university and public libraries.  A Chicago public television station, WTTW 11, came under criticism when they refused to air the documentary.  The Coalition for Democracy in Public Television cited an obvious conflict of interest between the station's programming department and &quot;major channel 11 contributor General Electric,&quot; one of many powerful entities implicated in in the Tuskegee experiment Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â² The allegations of network bias in favor of corporate funders were categorically denied by the station but the documentary was never aired.\n\n\nThis is not the first time that a groundbreaking documentary on racial and social justice has been kept under conspicuously tight wraps.  The case of The Deadly Deception bears a close resemblance to that of the Blackside production Eyes on the Prize -- an award-winning 14-episode series originally aired on PBS in 1987 and 1990 often described as the quintessential documentary on the civil rights movement -- which was subject to a decade-long rebroadcast ban due to copyright filibustering by rights holders of some of the series' content (the use of the &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; song, owned by Time-Warner, was one such example).Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â³  Former leader of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, Lawrence Guyot, had this to say in response to the proprietary stranglehold: \n\n&quot;I would call upon everyone who has access to 'Eyes on the Prize' to openly violate any and all laws regarding its showing.&quot;\n\nA digital redistribution movement via BitTorrent and other filesharing networks as well as unlicensed public screenings in major US cities soon followed, both of which rallied immense popular support and effectively reintroduced the film into the mainstream.  The content in question has since been re-licensed and the series revived and reissued in DVD thanks to a $600,000 grant from the Ford Foundation and a personal $250,000 donation from Henry Louis Gates Jr., chairman of the African-American studies department at Harvard University.\n\nWhether or not there has been any comparable outcry for the redistribution of The Deadly Deception, the combination of the film's possibly engineered scarcity and great social and historical value make it meritorious of a similar share campaign by default.  The quality of this rip should aptly illustrate the condition of the VHS tape from which it originated.  Two previous copies had to be discarded due to such disrepair as to make them unwatchable.  If you would like to see this film restored to its original, reputable state, ask your library to purchase new copies of the film, or write Nova/WGBH and request that this important piece of investigative journalism be brought into the 21st century with a DVD release or remastered VHS.  Until then, seed, share, and distribute.  All foreign language subs are welcome and encouraged as well.\n\n\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Âº  &lt;http://www.tuskegee.edu/Global/Story.asp?s=1207586&gt;\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â¹  &lt;http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/listseason/&gt;\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â² Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â³  &lt;http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A14801-2005Jan16.html&gt;\n\nVideo\nSource: VHS\nFrame size: 560x416\nAspect Ratio: 4:3\nBitrate: 1603 Kbps\nFrame rate: 29.97 fps\nCodec: MPEG-4 Visual XviD 1.1\nContainer: .avi\n\nAudio\nSample Rate: 48.0 KHz\nBitrate: 128 Kbps VBR\nLanguage: English\nChannels: 2 (Stereo)\nFormat: .mp3\nNumber of Streams: 1","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:275d62470ae022e7dbfd93b730b8db6da5509432","amp;dn":"Nova+-+The+Deadly+Deception","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"275d62470ae022e7dbfd93b730b8db6da5509432","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,93,98,71,10,224,34,231,219,253,147,183,48,184,219,109,165,80,148,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
