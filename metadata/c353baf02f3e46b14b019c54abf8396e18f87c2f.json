Once trained, a Jedi must go where he is needed, to defend the New Republic and use the light side of the Force to help those in need.\n\nOn Coruscant, Chief of State Leia Organa Solo receives a desperate message from miners on the harsh world of Corbos. They have awakened something in their excavations and have come under attack. Luke sends Kyp Durron and the young clone Dorsk 82 to investigate and offer whatever assistance they can. But when Kyp and Dorsk 82 arrive on storm-swept Corbos, they find only an empty mining colony . . . and the scene of a terrible disaster.\n\n\n[Previously Uploaded] - Star Wars - Jedi - The Dark Side (#1-5) [Complete]:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8856768&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8856768&lt;/a&gt; \n\n** If you have any question please feel free to ask! **\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c353baf02f3e46b14b019c54abf8396e18f87c2f","amp;dn":"Star+Wars+-+Jedi+Academy+-+Leviathan+%28%231-4%29+%5BComplete%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c353baf02f3e46b14b019c54abf8396e18f87c2f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,83,186,240,47,62,70,177,75,1,156,84,171,248,57,110,24,248,124,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
