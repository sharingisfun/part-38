The Complete Guide to Dream Bathrooms features luscious photos of on-trend baths containing the fixtures, colors and special touches that are in demand right now. But unlike most inspirational books, it doesn't stop there. This book ventures a step further to show readers precisely how to translate their dreams into a concrete plan that makes sense. Finally, more than half of the book is devoted to giving shape to those plans with tools, materials and sweat equity. Packed with step-by-step color photos, the book tackles dozens of common bathroom remodeling projects that just about any do-it-yourself can accomplish.\n\nThis revision of Black &amp; DeckerÃ‚Â® The Complete Guide to Bathrooms retains the hardworking and highly detailed information that made the original version one of the all-time top-selling bathroom books for DIYers. The book also puts a fresh focus on subjects and products that are on the cutting edge of bathroom design, such as installing low-flow fixtures, bidets, jetted bathtubs, and even how to install a water-saving urinal.\n\n\nBy Ruth Strother\nPublished by Creative Publishing in 2010\nPDF, Retail, 288 pages, English ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2840fc399a01b4b7c63edb9dc9ad487c3137c40e","amp;dn":"The+Complete+Guide+to+Dream+Bathrooms%28PDF%2CRetail%29%7B32Skulls%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2840fc399a01b4b7c63edb9dc9ad487c3137c40e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,64,252,57,154,1,180,183,198,62,219,157,201,173,72,124,49,55,196,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
