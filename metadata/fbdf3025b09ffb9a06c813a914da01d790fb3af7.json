That   \n  most of us can be bought or sold. And that sometimes, it actually     \n  feels good. Were all coerced and serenaded by advertising, an        \n  industry devoted to changing our minds and our behaviour.             \n                                                                        \n  But advertising is not the only industry that wants to get inside     \n  our heads and move the furniture around. Which brings us to spin,     \n  branding, and image control. Along with advertising, they form the    \n  nervous system of 21st century life. Theyre the levers pulled        \n  behind most news stories, the silent partners in public debates.      \n                                                                        \n  Gruen thinks its time to look at these dark arts as well. Because    \n  everyone is on the sell. Tyrants. Sports stars. Actors. Criminals.    \n  Politicians. Deities. Charities. Entire nations. Theyre all trying   \n  to persuade us to think, buy or do things that we werent thinking,   \n  buying or doing yesterday.                                            \n                                                                        \n  Gruen Planet, our latest show -in advertising they call it a brand    \n  extension- will run an x ray across the world each week, unpicking    \n  the stories that affect us all. How do you protect an unstable        \n  government when a backbencher goes feral? Does Tiger cut it anymore   \n  as a business? How has the Arab uprising been turned into Western     \n  profit? What was the Dalai Lama doing on Masterchef? Who do you turn  \n  to when your family name is your brand and its become toxic?         \n                                                                        \n  Each week, host Wil Anderson will be joined by regulars Todd Sampson  \n  and Russel Howcroft, along with some of Australias smartest          \n  communications experts. They will take us inside the persuasion       \n  business and explain why the world appears, not as it really is, but  \n  as others want us to see it. Why everything is spin, branding,        \n  advertising and image control.                                        \n                                                                        \n &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.abc.net.au/tv/gruenplanet/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.abc.net.au/tv/gruenplanet/&lt;/a&gt;                                 \n                                                                        \n \n\n  WE'RE LOOKiNG FOR \n                                                   \n                                                                        \n  * Broadcast/Network/PPV TV Cappers with English PDTV/HDTV sources     \n     located in the US/UK/AU/CA/EU                                      \n  * People with PDTV/HDTV sources with an interest in capping           \n  * Pre-retail/unreleased DVD Suppliers (especially sports)             \n  * 100mbit+ affil sites with archives                                  \n                                                                        \n   Find us or email &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;daadeebcb9a8bfad9abdb7bbb3b6f4b9b5b7&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt; if you can help                   \n                                                                        \n \n\n  GREETZ \n                                                              \n                                                                        \n   To all W4F/CLASSiCW4F members, both past and present. :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fbdf3025b09ffb9a06c813a914da01d790fb3af7","amp;dn":"Gruen.Planet.S04E11.WS.PDTV.XviD-W4F","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fbdf3025b09ffb9a06c813a914da01d790fb3af7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,223,48,37,176,159,251,154,6,200,19,169,20,218,1,215,144,251,58,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
