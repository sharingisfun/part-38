Anyway, it's something to read while you're waiting for Injustice to come out. Seed and enjoy!  --STF\n\n------\n\nFrom Atomic Avenue:\n\nPitt is Dale Keown's first work for Image Comics. Its star is a huge creature named Pitt, who shares his consciousness with an energy being named Jereb. Pitt was created by a splicing of human and Creed genes to become a deadly killing machine. Now, the very forces that created him have deemed him a traitor. Pitt fled to Earth where he must save not only himself, but a small child named Timmy from the galactic bruisers that want to kill them both.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:44882a9f70bace9f96ed214faa4e7c931d9fef89","amp;dn":"PITT+%281993-1999%29+001-020+COMPLETE+plus+1%2F2%2C+Hulk%2C+Darkness+X-ove","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"44882a9f70bace9f96ed214faa4e7c931d9fef89","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,136,42,159,112,186,206,159,150,237,33,79,170,78,124,147,29,159,239,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
