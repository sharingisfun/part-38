So you start to watch a movie but you have to leave... don't worry, when you open that movie again it will resume at the same point you left it, and with the same settings: audio track, subtitles, volume...\n\n\nOther additional interesting features:\n\nConfigurable subtitles. You can choose font and size, and even colors for the subtitles.\n\nAudio track switching. You can choose the audio track you want to listen. Works with avi and mkv. And of course with DVDs.\n\nSeeking by mouse wheel. You can use your mouse wheel to go forward or backward in the video.\n\nVideo equalizer, allows you to adjust the brightness, contrast, hue, saturation and gamma of the video image.\n\nMultiple speed playback. You can play at 2X, 4X... and even in slow motion.\n\nFilters. Several filters are available: deinterlace, postprocessing, denoise... and even a karaoke filter (voice removal).\n\nAudio and subtitles delay adjustment. Allows you to sync audio and subtitles.\n\nAdvanced options, such as selecting a demuxer or video &amp; audio codecs.\n\nPlaylist. Allows you to enqueue several files to be played one after each other. \n\nAutorepeat and shuffle supported too.\n\nPreferences dialog. You can easily configure every option of SMPlayer by using a nice preferences dialog.\n\nPossibility to search automatically for subtitles in opensubtitles.org.\n\nTranslations: currently SMPlayer is translated into more than 20 languages, including Spanish, German, French, Italian, Russian, Chinese, Japanese....\n\nIt's multiplatform. Binaries available for Windows and Linux.\n\nSMPlayer is under the GPL license.\n\n\nMost important changes since 0.6.5:\n\n* Added an option to generate a preview (thumbnails) of the video.\n* Added a new gui (mpcgui, a media player classic clone) developed by \n  Matthias Petri.\n* Added some auto zoom options, to display the video without black borders.\n* Implemented a new (and optional) method to save the file settings.\n  This method uses an ini file per each played file. It's faster than the old\n  one.\n* Added a new option in Preferences-&gt;Video: add black borders on\n  fullscreen. If this option is enabled, black borders will be added to\n  the image in fullscreen mode. This allows subtitles to be displayed on\n  the black borders.\n* Increased the resolution of the seekbar. Allows a more accurate seeking.\n* Added 3 modes for the stay on top option: always, never and while playing.\n* Added a history to the open URL dialog.\n* Added new action to cycle through all aspect ratios. Assigned by default to \n  key &quot;A&quot;.\n* It's possible to run some specified actions every time a file is loaded.\n* Possibility to set up a proxy for internet connections (used for subtitle\n  downloading).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c25a3325ed47bff21e3ba5023820dd688f368de","amp;dn":"SMPlayer+0.6.6","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c25a3325ed47bff21e3ba5023820dd688f368de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,37,163,50,94,212,123,255,33,227,186,80,35,130,13,214,136,243,104,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
