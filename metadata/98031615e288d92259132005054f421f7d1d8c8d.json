That's DC, Vertigo (ugghh!)Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â®, Wildstorm, Helix, Milestone, Minx, Paradox, Piranha, Tangent, America's Best Comics, Cliffhanger, CMX, Homage, Humanoids, and MC.Gaines among others.\n       Plus, for characters and titles DC picked up from other companies, as much of those &quot;Pre-DC&quot; comics as I can find. This includes many major and minor DC superheroes, war comics, romance comics and various licensed characters such as Tarzan, Star Trek, Loony Toons, Scooby-Doo etc. A few of the heros include Shazam!, Blue Beetle, Plastic Man, Gen13, The Web, The Shield, Phantom Lady, Captain Atom and many more. There may be a lot of things you didn't know started with a different company. There will some &quot;Post DC&quot; comics of characters like Fallen Angel that have moved on. But that will be arbitrarily selective on my part. Assorted related material will be included. It's going to be 750-800gb in total. It will take a year or two. I've already done a 600+gb subset of this in an earlier project (MTCDC). So clearly, I'm insane, which is what you look for in a guy promising this. So here we go again, but bigger.\n\nThe Batman A-Z  torrent was well received so I thought I try doing this in bigger chunks.  This one was planned as two and is now one. Don't worry if you are behind,  I'm still seeding the Batman at a good clip as I'm not happy with the seed to peer ratio yet. If big chunks don't get seeded, if necessary I'll repost as two and switch back to smaller torrents\n\nToday's offering: DC from Big All American to Blue Devil with some good pre-dc additions\n\nSome cover thumbnails here\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img703.imageshack.us/img703/9332/mtcdcnmc09.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img703.imageshack.us/img703/9332/mtcdcnmc09.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEnjoy!\n\nBig All American Comic Book ctc (Wise-All-American(1944)\n\nThese  Big Bang comics from Image-Caliber I have not read or researched, but it only takes glance to see they are closely modeled after DC, and are tongue-in-cheek recreations of DC and sometimes others at various time in Comics history.\n\nBig Bang Comics Summer Special 001-Golden Age (08-2003)\nBig Bang Comics v1 0, 01-04 (Caliber(1994-1995)\nBig Bang Comics v2 01-35 (Image(1996-2001)\nBig Bang Presents v3 (2006)\nBig Bang Presents-Ultiman Family v1 001 (Image(02-2005)\nBig Bang Presents-Whiz Kids\nBig Bang-Round Table of America 001 (Image(02-2004)\nMighty Man 001 (2004)\nUltiman Giant Annual (2001)\n\nBig Book of Fun Comics 001-reprints New Fun 01-04-unscanned.jpg (reprints anyway)\n\nBig Books of Paradox\nThe Big Book of Bad\nThe Big Book of Conspiracies\nThe Big Book of Death\nThe Big Book of Freaks\nThe Big Book of Grimm\nThe Big Book of Hoaxes\nThe Big Book of Little Criminals\nThe Big Book of Losers\nThe Big Book of Martyrs\nThe Big Book of Scandal\nThe Big Book of The 70s.\nThe Big Book of The Weird Wild West\nThe Big Book of Thugs\nThe Big Book of Urban Legends\nThe Big Book of Vice\nThe Big Book of Weirdos\nThe Big Book of the Unexplained (1997) now with p31 of sec 2\n\nBig Daddy Danger 01-09 (2002-2003)\nBig Town 01-50 (1951-1958)\nBigg Time 01 (Vertigo(2002)\n\nA little extra Bill &amp; Ted\nBill and Ted's Bogus Journey (Marvel1991)\nBill and Ted's Excellent Comic Book 01-12 (Marvel(991-1992)\nBill and Teds Excellent Adventure-Movie Adaptation 33p (DC(1989)\n\nBilly Batson &amp; the Magic of Shazam 01-21 (2008-2010)\nBinky 72-82 (after Leave it to Binky 71 (1970-1971)\nBinky's Buddies 01-12 (1969-1970)\nBionicle v1 01-27 (2001-2005)\nBionicle-Battle for Power #12-13\nBionicle-Glatorian #02,04\nBionicle-Ignition #08-10 (2006-2007)\nBionicle-Unmasked 09p (2003)\n\nBirds of Prey\nBirds of Prey 01-02-Batgirl Catwoman Oracle (2003)\nBirds of Prey Secret Files &amp; Origins-Batgirl-Oracle-Black Canary-Huntress (2003)\nBirds of Prey TPB reprints Unscanned\nBirds of Prey v1 001-127 (1999-2009)\nBirds of Prey v2 01-xx (2010-20xx)\nBirds of Prey-Batgirl-w Black Canary (1998)\nBirds of Prey-Black Canary and Oracle TPB (1999)\nBirds of Prey-Manhunt 01-04 Black Canary Oracle (1996)\nBirds of Prey-Revolution-Black Canary Oracle (1997)\nBirds of Prey-The Ravens-GirlFrenzy (1998)\nBirds of Prey-Wolves-Black Canary Oracle (1997)\nBirds of Prey-of Like Minds TPB-Extras (2004)\n\nBite Club 01-06 (2004)\nBite Club-Vampire Crime Unit 01-05 (2006)\nBizarro Comics\nBizarro World\nA.
