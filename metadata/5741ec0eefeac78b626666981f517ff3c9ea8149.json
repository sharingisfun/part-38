In Monet's Giverny, natural forms respond instantly to light. The images produce a peculiar sense of floating in the viewer - many of the pictures lack a horizon line or any indication of where the viewer is in relation to the picture. As a result, we seem to hover in flight, poised above a constantly shifting panorama of woods, water, fields, and lilies. Interestingly, no human figures are visible in these works (Monet was never really a figure painter) producing a peculiar sensation of isolation and contemplation in the spectator - we wander through this magical land alone, or with whatever companion we desire. A superlative achievement which has found few imitators in the world of art publishing.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5741ec0eefeac78b626666981f517ff3c9ea8149","amp;dn":"Monet%27s+Years+at+Giverny+-+Beyond+Impressionism+%28Art+Paintings+E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5741ec0eefeac78b626666981f517ff3c9ea8149","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,65,236,14,239,234,199,139,98,102,102,152,31,81,127,243,201,234,129,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
