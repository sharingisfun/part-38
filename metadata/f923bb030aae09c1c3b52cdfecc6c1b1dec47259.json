the ties that bind  us\n        together. Set in  the haunting landscapes  of the Hokianga  in\n        the  far north  of New  Zealand, this  stunning film  explores\n        tragedy, despair  and eventual  hope through  the straggles of\n        the Kaneha family.\n\n        Ten-year-old  twins Kimi  (Hato Paparoa)  and Melody  (Melanie\n        Mayall-Nahi) live happily in an isolated Maori community until\n        teenage drifter Tai  (Isaac Barber) arrives,  precipitating an\n        accident which forces the twins apart.\n\n        Without his sister. Kimi's world is thrown off balance.  While\n        others punish Tai, Kimi acts out his heartbreaking  loneliness\n        in destructive, angry ways, at the same time looking after the\n        Melody that only he can see. His family is concerned for  him,\n        but  only Kimi's  belief in  his sister  can save  him. As  he\n        searches  for  answers.  those  around  him  have  their   own\n        reactions. His brother Gene seeks violent revenge: his parents\n        grieve  silently  watchfully: and  lonely  teenage girl  Tirea\n        finds a fragile kind of love with the outcast Tai.\n\n        Also  starring  Nancy  Brunning (What  Becomes  of  the Broken\n        Hearted,  Crooked  Earth)   and  Jim  Moriarty   (The  Waimate\n        Conspiracy,  The  Returning)  The  Strength  of  Water  is the\n        acclaimed directorial debut from New Zealand director  Armagan\n        Ballantyne from a script by the award-winning playwright Briar\n        Grace-Smith.\n\n     \n                                           \n                      CAST                       \n                                               \n                                                       \n     \n\n                Isaac Barber         ....
