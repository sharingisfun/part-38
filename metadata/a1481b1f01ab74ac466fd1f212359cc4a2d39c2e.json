Check it out till you get a visit from Homelandsecurity.\nLossless in FLAC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn old Arab lived close to New York City for more than 40 years. One day, he decided that he would love to plant potatoes and herbs in his garden, but he knew he was alone and too old and weak. His son was in college in Paris, so the old man sent him an e-mail explaining the problem:\n\n&quot;Beloved son, I am very sad, because I can't plant potatoes in my garden.\nI am sure, if only you were here, that you would help me and dig up the garden for me. I love you, your father.&quot;\n\nThe following day, the old man received a response e-mail from his son:\n\n&quot;Beloved father, please don't touch the garden. That is where I have hidden the THING.' I love you, too, Ahmed.&quot;\n\nAt 4pm the FBI and the Rangers visited the house of the old man and took the whole garden apart, searching every inch. But they couldn't find anything. Dissappointed, they left the house. The next day, the old man received another e-mail from his son:\n\n&quot;Beloved father, I hope the garden is dug up by now and you can plant your potatoes. That is all I could do for you from here. Your loving son, Ahmed&quot;.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a1481b1f01ab74ac466fd1f212359cc4a2d39c2e","amp;dn":"Dissidenten+-+Shara+Electric+%2F+Live+at+ThePyramids+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a1481b1f01ab74ac466fd1f212359cc4a2d39c2e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,72,27,31,1,171,116,172,70,111,209,242,18,53,156,196,162,211,156,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
