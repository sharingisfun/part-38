In 1973 the Scobie family moved to Salisbury, Rhodesia. \n\nOne day, while still at school, David was called in to Shed Studios by Steve Roskilly and Clem Tholet to sing on an advertising jingle called 'Travelling Man', which went on to win an advertising award. In 1980 when David was fifteen, he was asked by Martin Norris, Steve Roskilly's partner, back to Shed studios to listen to a song Martin had written with David's voice in mind. David obliged and  'Gypsey Girl' was recorded. However, they needed another song for the B-side of the single and so the unanimous decision to use David's first composition, 'Don't Pass Me By', was made.\n\nThe single was released in October 1980 and it went to No.1 in Zimbabwe that November, staying there for an unbelievable four months. It was then released in South Africa in April 1981 and it bounced up and down the Springbok charts for nineteen weeks. The single went gold in both countries and David became an over-night celebrity. His next single &quot;Taking The Easy Way Home&quot; was recorded in April 1981 and by that June it had reached the Top Ten in both territories again. He went on to release a further four albums and numerous singles.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.davidscobie.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.davidscobie.org&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nALBUMS:\n\nCleaning Up!\nPhotograph\nSpecial Edition\nPeace Dream - Songs Of Clem Tholet\nScottish Songs\nScottish Songs 2\n\n\nAll tracks in MP3 format, 256kbps\n\nPlease Seed The File !!\n\nPLEASE SUPPORT THE ARTISTS BY PURCHASING THEIR MUSIC!!\n\nScanned with ESET SMART SECURITY: No Threats or Infections\n\nEnjoy !!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d56d0557bbbd8f256866ed98d5029e798d7de81b","amp;dn":"David+Scobie+++-+++6+Albums","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d56d0557bbbd8f256866ed98d5029e798d7de81b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,109,5,87,187,189,143,37,104,102,237,152,213,2,158,121,141,125,232,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
