The fifth edition uses all strands of the &quot;Rule of Four&quot; - graphical, numeric, symbolic/algebraic, and verbal/applied presentations - to make concepts easier to understand. The book focuses on exploring fundamental ideas rather than comprehensive coverage of multiple similar cases that are not fundamentally unique.\n\nEbook details\tISBN : 0470089156 | December 3, 2008 | 739 pages | PDF | 22MB\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:079f72184481187d5f893a295bc4fb288d330d49","amp;dn":"Calculus%3A++Single+Variable+%285th+Edition%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"079f72184481187d5f893a295bc4fb288d330d49","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,159,114,24,68,129,24,125,95,137,58,41,91,196,251,40,141,51,13,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
