I flew from San Diego to go to this concert as my friend&amp;#039;s band was one of the many opening for them (Psycho Saga).\nThe bootleg came out pretty decent considering the elements. The Rave isn&amp;#039;t known for the greatest sound, but besides that is the entire show i was in the front few rows off to the left side. This of course means constant bumping, pushing and rocking out from others, myself and the mosh pit.\nFor the most part the quality of this bootleg is not too shabby, the first 6 songs or so are the &quot;worst&quot; part due to lots of people singing, but eventually theirs, as well as my own got sore and we were forced to stop lol. \nThe best part of this bootleg is definitely the solos, most of the solos sound quite nice, so enjoy them!\n\n\n\n\nBrought to you by: \n\n\n- JITF (JumpInTheFire) \n\n\nMore Bootlegs Than Your Mom Can Handle  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.ClanKrW.net&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.ClanKrW.net&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:82eb9c41860237c5e63a181269d21624b1b33cfb","amp;dn":"Megadeth+-+September+19%2C+2007+-+The+Rave+-+Milwaukee%2C+Wisconsin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"82eb9c41860237c5e63a181269d21624b1b33cfb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,235,156,65,134,2,55,197,230,58,24,18,105,210,22,36,177,179,60,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
