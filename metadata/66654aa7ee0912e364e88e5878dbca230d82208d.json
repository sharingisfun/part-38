Innovations included the ability to play all the main characters as the game's protagonist, and to this day, its epic story intertwining each of their fates is still highly rated and wildly popular. The characters' dramatic performances are also highly rated, including the catastrophe occurring midway through, which delivers a particular emotional jolt to players.\n\nWith plenty of abilities available and the magicite system for controlling spells/summoning, players can develop their characters any way they want. This was also the first FINAL FANTASY game to include the Ultima Weapon, the most powerful sword of all and a recurring item in subsequent titles within the series.\n\n\nFeatures\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Game data saved with iCloud can now be shared across devices!

This leads to a fateful meeting between Terra and a young man named Locke. Their harrowing escape from the Empire's clutches sets in motion a series of events that touches countless lives and leads to one inevitable conclusion.\n\n*****************************\nRecommended Devices:\n- iPhone 4S or later\n- iPad 2 or later\n\nCertain in-game conditions may cause the app to close unexpectedly on iPhone 4.
