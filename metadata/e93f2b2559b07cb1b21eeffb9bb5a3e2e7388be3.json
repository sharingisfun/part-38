Mastered by Philipp Borisov (Parahype) with cover design by Elena Ukolova (Ulsei). Music by Pavel Shirshin, Kazan, Russia.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e93f2b2559b07cb1b21eeffb9bb5a3e2e7388be3","amp;dn":"Cosmic+Replicant+-+Soul+Of+The+Universe+%282014%29+Album+%40++MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e93f2b2559b07cb1b21eeffb9bb5a3e2e7388be3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,63,43,37,89,176,124,177,178,30,239,251,155,181,163,226,231,56,139,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
