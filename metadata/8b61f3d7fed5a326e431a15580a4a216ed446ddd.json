Anderson Thomson, Jr., MD, with Clare Aukofer, offers a succinct yet comprehensive study of how and why the human mind generates religious belief. Dr. Thomson, a highly respected practicing psychiatrist with credentials in forensic psychiatry and evolutionary psychology, methodically investigates the components and causes of religious belief in the same way any scientist would investigate the movement of astronomical bodies or the evolution of life over timeÃ¢â‚¬â€that is, as a purely natural phenomenon. Providing compelling evidence from psychology, the cognitive neurosciences, and related fields, he, with Ms. Aukofer, presents an easily accessible and exceptionally convincing case that god(s) were created by manÃ¢â‚¬â€not vice versa. With this slim volume, Dr. Thomson establishes himself as a must-read thinker and leading voice on the primacy of reason and science over superstition and religion.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b61f3d7fed5a326e431a15580a4a216ed446ddd","amp;dn":"Why+We+Believe+in+God%28s%29%3A+A+Concise+Guide+%282011%29+epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b61f3d7fed5a326e431a15580a4a216ed446ddd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,97,243,215,254,213,163,38,228,49,161,85,128,164,162,22,237,68,109,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
