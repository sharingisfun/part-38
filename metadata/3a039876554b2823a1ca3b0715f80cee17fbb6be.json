It was released by DG in 1983. (Funny to remember: in 1983 it was mainly purchased as a record or a cassette tape! I didn't know anyone with a CD player in 1983.)\n\nPlease enjoy.\n\nMP3 @ 320","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a039876554b2823a1ca3b0715f80cee17fbb6be","amp;dn":"Brahms+-+The+Cello+Sonatas+-+Serkin%2C+Rostropovich","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a039876554b2823a1ca3b0715f80cee17fbb6be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,3,152,118,85,75,40,35,161,202,59,7,21,248,12,238,23,251,182,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
