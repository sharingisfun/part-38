This is the RIFFTRAX version of the film. The commentary cannot be turned off.\nIf you\\&amp;#039;re looking for the normal version of the film, look elsewhere.\n\n\nXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n\n   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.rifftrax.com/donate.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.rifftrax.com/donate.php&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThis torrent was created to simplify the confusing Rifftrax syncing process. Having the riff and the film all in one AVI file or DVD is a million times more enjoyable than trying to sync everything together. Plus Disembaudio is annoying.\n\nThe makers of the original movie I don\\&amp;#039;t care about, but the Rifftrax crew (Mike, Bill, Kevin, and all their peons) need $ to keep making these!\n\nRIFFS ONLY COST $4!!! PLEASE DONATE IF YOU ENJOY THIS RIFFTRAX!!!\n\nThanks,\nAnna\n   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.rifftrax.com/donate.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.rifftrax.com/donate.php&lt;/a&gt;\t\t\n\n\nXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n\n\nTheatrical Version (not Director\\&amp;#039;s Cut)\n720x480\nXVID AVI\n1:31:25\n763 MB\n\n\nXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n\n\nThe scariest thing to come out of Japan since Pink Lady, The Grudge tells the story of a young woman who travels to Japan with her underwear-sniffing boyfriend and soon finds herself in the clutches of an evil curse (as if having an underwear-sniffing boyfriend wasn\\&amp;#039;t bad enough). \n\nBill Pullman co-stars, sort of, in that he speaks several lines of dialogue. In contrast to a high body count slasher film, The Grudge is infused with a suffocating sense of dread, very much like an average episode of According to Jim. Kevin Murphy and Mike Nelson settle their own grudge in this not-to-be-missed RiffTrax.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a5497f07ee9819d730364a39dc9e0025de021ab3","amp;dn":"The+Grudge+Rifftrax+%28AVI%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a5497f07ee9819d730364a39dc9e0025de021ab3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,73,127,7,238,152,25,215,48,54,74,57,220,158,0,37,222,2,26,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
