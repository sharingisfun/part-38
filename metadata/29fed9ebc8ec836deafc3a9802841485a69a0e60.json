Recently you may have heard Alison ShawÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s distinctively childlike vocal on the latest full-length from Ghostly International electronica hounds Twine, which aptly seemed to reference a very Cranes-styled approach to dream pop. The opening track here, ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½DioramaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½, makes moves towards the world of electronic music, taking on a sliced-and-diced, granular sound as a brief introduction before moving into more conventional territory on the airy reverb of ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½WorldsÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½. On tracks like ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½FeathersÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ the band take this sound even further, rendering an ethereal, wraith-like sound from the most ordinary and simple of elements. ItÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s all very convincing and accomplished, but you do find yourself wondering why the experimental electronics of that opening track havenÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½t been put into use elsewhere on the record. Eventually, ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½SleepwalkingÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ dishes out some very welcome shuffled up drone textures before final track ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½High and LowÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ comes to life with warm, frothy guitars and twinkling keyed sounds - ShawÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s voice mirrored by the celestial echo flecks running through the production.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29fed9ebc8ec836deafc3a9802841485a69a0e60","amp;dn":"Cranes+-+Cranes+%5Bmp3-320-2008%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29fed9ebc8ec836deafc3a9802841485a69a0e60","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,254,217,235,200,236,131,109,234,252,58,152,2,132,20,133,166,154,14,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
