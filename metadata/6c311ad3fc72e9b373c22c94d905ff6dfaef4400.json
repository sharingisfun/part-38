We'll start off by using a developed base mesh and learn how to change it's features into the character we want it to be. \n\nHere we'll gradually build up the characters facial features, discussing how to break out of the mode of &quot;just making a pretty face&quot; and how to be more intentional about design. Then we'll start working on clothing for our character. \n\nWe'll talk about extracting geometry, remeshing, creating proper folds, and using layers to keep your design flexible. Finally, we'll talk about how to bring the entire character design together to make it cohesive and ultimately appealing.\n\n\n\nTopics include:\n\n01.Getting Started\n\n02.Moving Forward\n\n03.Adding Media\n\n04.Keeping Your Clips Organized\n\n05.Editing Essentials\n\n06.On the Job Training\n\n7.Refining the upper body\n\n8.Adding mass to the hands\n\n9.Detailing the hands\n\n10.Extracting the clothes\n\n11.Refining the t-shirt\n\n12.Realistically adding mass to the shirt\n\n13.Blocking in the major folds\n\n14.Refining the major folds\n\n15.Adding memory folds\n\n16.Adding a damage layer\n\n17.Adjusting the proportions of the pants\n\n18.Adding the major folds of the pants\n\n19.Refining the folds of the pants\n\n20.Creating the back pockets of the pants\n\n21.Creating the seams of the pants\n\n22.Extracting the boots\n\n23.Retopologizing the boot\n\n24.Shaping the boot to the foot\n\n25.Creating the layered boot elements\n\n26.Creating the boot strap and buckle\n\n27.Finishing the boots\n\n28.Bringing the pants, boots, and shirt together\n\n29.Blocking in the coat\n\n30.Creating the design of the coat\n\n31.Finishing the coat\n\n32.Creating the hood\n\n33.Creating the gloves\n\n34.Adding pores and wrinkles to the face\n\n35.Adding low resolution hair","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c311ad3fc72e9b373c22c94d905ff6dfaef4400","amp;dn":"%5BDigital+Tutors%5D+Character+Development+Techniques+in+ZBrush+Vide","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c311ad3fc72e9b373c22c94d905ff6dfaef4400","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,49,26,211,252,114,233,179,115,194,44,148,217,5,255,109,250,239,68,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
