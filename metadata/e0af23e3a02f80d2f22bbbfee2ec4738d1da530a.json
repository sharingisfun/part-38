With traditional instruments like penny \nwhistle, fiddle, harmonium, and mandolin, Dr. Strangely Strange was more solidly rooted in \nmelody and structure than the group's flaky Scottish counterparts. Produced by British modern \nfolk guru Joe Boyd (Fairport Convention, Incredible String Band), Kip of the Serenes is built \naround simple and repetitious melodies occasionally interrupted by stream-of-consciousness \nmusical and lyrical diversions.&quot;\nThis simplistic approach would be abandoned with their 1970 follow-up, Heavy Petting, which saw \ntheir first partnership with electric guitarist Gary Moore.\n ~ (by: Dave Sleger, All Music Guide) \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e0af23e3a02f80d2f22bbbfee2ec4738d1da530a","amp;dn":"Dr.+Strangely+Strange+-+Kip+Of+The+Serenes+%28Ireland+1969+folk%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e0af23e3a02f80d2f22bbbfee2ec4738d1da530a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,175,35,227,160,47,128,210,242,43,187,254,226,236,71,56,209,218,83,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
