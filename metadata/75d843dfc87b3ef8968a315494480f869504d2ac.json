J Bonner is the leader of The Black Emeralds, and he and I are in the Engine Room together, and we both played on Jimmy CliffÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Rebirth album. J, and his cousin Salina also played with me on my solo record, A PoetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Life. Bobby Freeman wrote this tune, but I still consider this a Ramones song. This is our third Ramones cover.\n \nTim Timebomb-Vocals, Guitar\nJ Bonner-Bass, Organ, Guitar, Piano\nSalina Cano-Percussion\nJason cool breeze Castillo-Drums\nRuben Durazo-Trombone\nRobbie Spengler-Sax","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:75d843dfc87b3ef8968a315494480f869504d2ac","amp;dn":"Do+You+Wanna+Dance+-+Tim+Timebomb.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"75d843dfc87b3ef8968a315494480f869504d2ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,216,67,223,200,123,62,248,150,138,49,84,148,72,15,134,149,4,210,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
