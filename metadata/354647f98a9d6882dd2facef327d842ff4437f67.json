After reuniting in the late &amp;#039;80s, MF aimed at the urban contemporary market with Looks Could Kill -- a pedestrian, forgettable effort that had very little going for it. But the Led Zeppelin-influenced band more than made up for that artistic blunder with the heartfelt Black Radio Won&amp;#039;t Play This Record. Taking off the gloves (both musically and lyrically) and throwing urban contemporary considerations to the wind, MF excels by doing what it does best: scorching heavy metal and hard rock with a touch of Ike &amp; Tina Turner-ish soul. Lead singers Joyce Kennedy and Glenn Murdock are as passionate as ever, and the songwriting is first-rate. While &quot;Like a Negro&quot; protests racism and &quot;Stop&quot; warns that unsafe sex can result in AIDS, &quot;Crack Babies&quot; addresses the horrors of babies born to cocaine-addicted mothers. MF&amp;#039;s small but devoted following hoped that this album (arguably its heaviest since 1981&amp;#039;s Iron Age) would save the headbangers from obscurity, but sadly, it enjoyed little attention.
