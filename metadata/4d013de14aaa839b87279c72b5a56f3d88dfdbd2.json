The target of the matchmakers is widowed vintner Magali (BÃƒÂ©atrice Romand), alone at her vineyard after the departure of her grown children. Her best friend (Marie RiviÃƒÂ¨re) plots to pair her with a friendly businessman (Alain Libolt), while her son's girlfriend (Alexia Portal) schemes to introduce her to a high-school philosophy teacher.
