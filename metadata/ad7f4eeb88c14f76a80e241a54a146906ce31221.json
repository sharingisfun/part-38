Wander must travel across a vast expanse on horseback and defeat sixteen massive beings, known simply as colossi, in order to restore the life of a girl named Mono. The game is unusual within the action-adventure genre in that there are no towns or dungeons to explore, no characters with which to interact, and no enemies to defeat other than the colossi.Shadow of the Colossus has been described as a puzzle game, as each colossus' weakness must be identified and exploited before it can be defeated.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad7f4eeb88c14f76a80e241a54a146906ce31221","amp;dn":"Shadow+of+The+Colossus+PS2+%28Fabio5ilva%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ad7f4eeb88c14f76a80e241a54a146906ce31221","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,127,78,235,136,193,79,118,168,14,36,26,84,161,70,144,108,227,18,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
