Privileged to be a beta reader for this book, I found Cadman's Gambit a pure pleasure from start to finish. From the outset, Prior captures the reader's imagination with the rich presentation and description of other-worldly Sektis Gandaw and his quest for the hidden pieces of the Ain Gana artifact before expertly switching gears to reveal the swordsman hero, Deacon Shader, doing what he does best--sword fighting. Prior masterfully leads you into this mysterious new world, steeped in intrigue and danger, quickly immersing you the story. Once you start you lose yourself completely in the illusion--a sign of real brilliance and talent! Having read a couple of Prior's previous novellas (Thanatos, Antman), I was already a fan. As always, his writing communicates an immediacy and intensity that instantly draws you in and keeps you on the edge of your seat with action and tension up through to the climactic (and shocking) conclusion. Moreover, unlike Thanatos and Antman, Cadman's Gambit is literally brimming with character development--from the gritty, embittered Shadrac to the deliciously devilish Cadman. Each new personality (even the supporting ones) is not only completely believable (who doesn't know someone like the conniving and egocentric Justin or the salacious, self-serving Lalia?) but also wonderfully flawed (from Cadman's hilarious obsessions to Shader's dark demons) just like real people. This makes it very easy to relate to the characters, even when they do horrific and incomprehensible things (like Gaston does early on) that would otherwise turn you completely against them. It takes real skill to accomplish this but Prior does it almost effortlessly. The cliff-hanger ending does leave you wanting more but I understand that the sequel, Best Laid Plans, will be following shortly. I just hope that I am asked to beta read that one as well so I can get an advance peek!\n\nBest Laid Plans:\nThe reavers are swarming and this time their prey is the supreme ruler of the Templum, the Ipsissimus himself. With Shader dead and his piece of the Statue of Eingana in the hands of Shadrak the Unseen, the threat of the Unweaving of all Creation is one step nearer. Dr Cadman realizes heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s in too deep and thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nothing for it but to go on the offensive. If heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s to survive the coming war for the statue, what better allies could he have than an army of the living dead? As Sektis Gandaw closes in and a clash of cultures threatens the land of Sahul, the philosopher Aristodeus still has ideas of his own that could decide the fate of all existence. But with the passage to the heavenly realm of Araboth covered by the Abyss, nothing is as it should be. Aristodeus knows that even ShaderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s death can be turned to his advantage; after all, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a long game, and he holds all the cards. But even the best laid plans Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ Best Laid Plans is Book 2 of the epic Shader series by D.P. Prior.\n\n_______________________________________\n\nfor any queries and reseeds if the file is not downloading pm/request reseed.\n\nIf you do like my uploads do support me by commenting and rating the torrent . also please help me keep the torrent alive by sharing and seeding.. !\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3898f422cfe210e9c2ad6c824e104d07c32e5d8f","amp;dn":"Shader+Series+_D.+P.+Prior+EPUB+%7EKnightinKat","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3898f422cfe210e9c2ad6c824e104d07c32e5d8f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,152,244,34,207,226,16,233,194,173,108,130,78,16,77,7,195,46,93,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
