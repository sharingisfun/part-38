Its followers recognize both the Bible and the Qur'an as holy texts, and practice &quot;running deliverance,&quot; a distinctive practice of spiritual running which members liken to Joshua's army circling Jericho, or the Muslim practice of circumambulating the Kaaba.\n\nThe religion has about 1,500 adherents.\n\nHistory\n\nThere are two different religious movements of Chrislam in Nigeria, one called Ifeoluwa and founded by Tela Tella in the 1980s and another called Oke-Tude founded by Samson Saka in 1999. Tela Tella claims that an angel of God came to him and told him that he gave him the mission and the name &quot;Ifeoluwa: The Will of God Mission&quot;.[3]\nBelief and worship\n\nChrislam uses both the Bible and QurÃ¢â‚¬â„¢an and sees them both as holy texts. During the worship service, verses are read from both the Bible and the Qur'an. The Chrislamic people believe that Muhammad, Moses and Jesus were all great prophets and we need to love them all.[3] Worship services include singing of Christian and Islamic hymns to praise God and attract his presence.[4] The people of the congregation are also free to shout out the name of Allah or God in worship. Christmas, Easter, Ramadan and other Christian and Islamic religions celebrations are accepted and celebrated without judgment or hostility. Inside their place of worship there is an altar similar to those built by Abraham where the worshipers pray and seek the face of God. There are prayers going on here most of the day.[4] Like a number of other proselytizing religions, they believe in evangelism and try to convert new members every day.\n\n \nIn the Oke Tude organization there are three different sessions or services that take place on Sunday. The first is a Muslim session, then a Christian session, and finally there is a joint session that Saka leads. During this he stresses the similarities between Christianity and Islamic beliefs.[3] In Ifeoluwa, they worship on Saturday because when they worshiped on Sunday the congregation claimed that Tela Tella was showing favoritism, since Christians worship on Sundays and Muslims worship on Fridays. The worship sessions on Saturday are held three times a day. Tela Tella believes in both the QurÃ¢â‚¬â„¢an and the Bible but says they are incomplete, and that is why he is writing his own book called the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ifeoluwa BookÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.[3] In Ifeoluwa there is an annual pilgrimage to The Mount of Authority, where the people pray for three days, and other annual festivals put on by Tela Tella. Tella also leads the singing of hymns during the Saturday service. Tella claims that these hymns were revealed to him by the angels Gabriel and Michael.[3]\nCriticisms\n\nSome have criticized Chrislam, citing irreconcilable differences between its two component religions.[5] According to Stephen Ellis, who together with Ineke Van Kessel edited the book, Movers and Shakers: Social Movements in Africa, the religion is &quot;rather exceptional and increasingly so.&quot; According to Sidney M. Greenfield, who wrote the book, Reinventing Religions:\n\nThe people who practice Chrislam see no fault with mixing the two religions, because they say that God loves all people and wants us to love all people. Saka says that when people criticize Chrislam he takes solace in what Jesus says about loving others in all religions.[4]\n\n\n[size=18]JESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.\n\nBorn of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.\n\n      :thankyou:    :thankyou:     Thank You JESUS  \n\n  ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56a66110060fea02010caa3e8560b8efd3814c67","amp;dn":"POtHS+-+Chrislam+Religion+-+Rick+Warrens+Abominations+of+Our+Cre","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56a66110060fea02010caa3e8560b8efd3814c67","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,166,97,16,6,15,234,2,1,12,170,62,133,96,184,239,211,129,76,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
