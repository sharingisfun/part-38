His partner in the project was recently found dead in the desert, suffering from a disease that normally takes years to advance but in his case seems to have afflicted him in only a few days. The local doctor, Matt Hastings, is puzzled by the strange case and with Deemer's recently arrived - and very pretty - assistant Stephanie Clayton tries to figure out what is going on. When cattle remains are found in the countryside, the evidence points to a giant tarantula as the culprit.\n\n\nNow here we go with a classic 1950's SciFi. I wonder if these were filmed with tongue in cheek by the studios or if they were serious all the way through.\n\nEnjoy ;-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b43e431dad3a45c816380f5aa6f2727d804a258","amp;dn":"Tarantula+%281955%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b43e431dad3a45c816380f5aa6f2727d804a258","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,67,228,49,218,211,164,92,129,99,128,245,170,111,39,39,216,4,162,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
