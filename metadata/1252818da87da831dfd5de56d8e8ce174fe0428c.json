(AP, 2005).pdf\r\n\r\nAs with the first edition of the Encyclopedia of Analytical Science, this second edition is designed to provide a detailed and comprehensive publication covering all facets of the science and practice of analysis. The new work has been extensively revised in terms of the titles and content of the first edition, and includes comprehensive coverage of techniques used for the determination of specific elements, compounds and groups of compounds, in physical or biological matrices. It addresses applications of chemical analysis in all areas, ranging from such topics as medicine to environmental science, and geology to food science. Important characterisation techniques, such as microscopy and surface analysis are also included.\r\n\r\nThe complete work consists of around 610 articles, each consisting of about 4000 words, figures and summary tables. These articles are combined to form larger entries providing comprehensive coverage of important topics and assisting the reader in locating material of interest. The entries are arranged in an A to Z format providing a final publication of about two and a half million words in ten volumes. The articles are structured to allow easy access to information on specific analytes, instrumental techniques and sample matrices. There is extensive cross-referencing throughout the Encyclopedia and a detailed index","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1252818da87da831dfd5de56d8e8ce174fe0428c","amp;dn":"Encyclopedia+of+Analytical+Science+2nd+ed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1252818da87da831dfd5de56d8e8ce174fe0428c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,82,129,141,168,125,168,49,223,213,222,86,216,232,206,23,79,224,66,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
