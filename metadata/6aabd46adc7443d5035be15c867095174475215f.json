For that last point, we consider flashback issues to be read a the point that the tale is being told, though issues that take place in the past are placed at that particular point in time.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6aabd46adc7443d5035be15c867095174475215f","amp;dn":"Batman+Reading+Order+-+Comic+Back+Issues++-+Part+1+1987-1991","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6aabd46adc7443d5035be15c867095174475215f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,171,212,106,220,116,67,213,3,91,225,92,134,112,149,23,68,117,33,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
