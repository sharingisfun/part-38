It was released in 1977 and includes the single &quot;Flammende Herzen&quot; b/w &quot;Karussell&quot;. The music was used the following year to soundtrack Flaming Hearts. It was Rother's first solo venture after having recorded five albums prior as a member of Neu! with Klaus Dinger and Harmonia with Cluster.\n\nThe album was recorded between June and September 1976 in Germany at Conny's Studio. Receiving positive reviews the album was released as an LP in March 1977.\n\nFollowing the disbandment of Neu! having released their third studio album Neu! '75 in 1975, Rother worked again with Neu! and Harmonia producer Conny Plank on his first solo album. Jaki Liebezeit from Can augmented Rother on drums. Aside from Liebezeit, the entirety of the album was written and performed by Rother utilising guitar, bass guitar, electric piano, organ, synthesizer and electronic percussion.[2] In contrast to Rother's work with his former groups, the album was completely instrumental instead based around his guitar.\n\nOn completion of the sessions Rother re-teamed with Cluster members Hans-Joachim Roedelius and Dieter Moebius and former-Roxy Music member and solo artist Brian Eno to record a third Harmonia album in Forst in 1976. The studio sessions were productive but the recordings were left unreleased until November 1997 when they were released as Tracks and Traces and credited to 'Harmonia 76'.\n\nTrack listing\nAll songs written and composed by Michael Rother. \n\nSide one\t\nNo.\t\t\t\n1.\t&quot;Flammende Herzen&quot;  \t7:04\n2.\t&quot;Zyklodrom&quot;  \t9:37\nSide two\t\nNo.\tTitle\tLength\t\n3.\t&quot;Karussell&quot;  \t5:22\n4.\t&quot;Feuerland&quot;  \t7:09\n5.\t&quot;Zeni&quot;  \t5:10\nCD bonus tracks\t\nNo.\tTitle\tLength\t\n6.\t&quot;Flammende Herzen - Film Remix 1993&quot;  \t8:32\n7.\t&quot;Vorbei (Flammende Herzen - Chill Remix 1993)&quot;  \t8:36","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b5ff90f1cec2843b0d7ea8cdbdbd3865ec64ba7","amp;dn":"Rother%2C+Michael+-+1976+-+Flammende+Herzen+%5BFlac%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3b5ff90f1cec2843b0d7ea8cdbdbd3865ec64ba7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,95,249,15,28,236,40,67,176,215,234,140,219,219,211,134,94,198,75,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
