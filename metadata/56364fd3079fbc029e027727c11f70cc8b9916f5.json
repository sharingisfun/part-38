As a whole, the volume is more comprehensive than any of the major single-authored works which have appeared in recent years; it achieves its goal of providing a guide to the literature as well as to the historical record. Second, the book enables us to evaluate the state of genocide historiography and studies. It shows us the deep contradictions between we may call the Ã¢â‚¬Å“oldÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ genocide studies and the new approaches, which themselves face formidable challenges in developing coherent historical interpretations. -- Martin Shaw, Journal of Genocide Research\n\nThis excellent book represents a substantial achievement by the editor. The individual essays are generally well-balanced and informative without being unnecessarily formulaic. They go beyond the remit of the title to actually offer new syntheses of the events as well as worthwhile assessments of existing interpretative literature. On the whole, this collection offers excellent value for teachers and scholars. Professor Stone has built on the strong foundations laid in his earlier edited work on the Historiography of the Holocaust, which also offered a mixture of interpretation and synthesis. -- Cathie Carmichael, Journal of Modern Jewish Studies\n\n&quot;This volume is an absolutely essential addition to any university library collection... Readers hoping to acquire a one-volume introduction to the dynamic field of genocide studies should read this book first.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€CHOICE\n\nAbout the Author\nDAN STONE is Professor of Modern History at Royal Holloway, University of London, UK.
