By multi-touch we mean a phone that can track the movement of two (or more) fingers at the same time on the screen. Most newer models supports this. Multi-touch allows you to control both flippers at the same time. The game will work without it, but the controls will be more difficult.\n- We recommend a resolution of 320x480 to better enjoy the game, but it will run on 240x320 as well.\n\nWhat's New:\n\n* Version 1.5.1 *\nCouple of bug fixes, including the sound prompt and some multiplayer issues.\nBig changes with the new version: there is now a multiplayer mode! We teamed up with Grantoo to provide you with the option to challenge your friends directly or play in tournament.\nYou will notice there are few new permissions for notifications to let you know when there is a challenge waiting for you. This permissions only apply to multiplayer.\nMultiplayer requires Android version 2.3.3.\n\nMore info:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.greencod.pinball.androidpremium&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.greencod.pinball.androidpremium&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a62e390f82e5dd8bcfab9ed32592b57ba85e9b81","amp;dn":"Pinball+Deluxe+Premium+v1.5.1+%5BPD%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a62e390f82e5dd8bcfab9ed32592b57ba85e9b81","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,46,57,15,130,229,221,139,207,171,158,211,37,146,181,123,168,94,155,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
