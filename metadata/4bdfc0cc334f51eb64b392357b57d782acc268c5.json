Epilogue (5:17)\n\nA stunning masterpiece from Swedish composer Magnus Birgersson who once again takes us by surprise and delivers a wide, lush and electric 10th album. Until we meet the sky has a an intensely cinematic sound; from introspective, wispy and intimate ambient electronica it slowly builds up to a shoegazing spirit engulfing the listener in an ethereal dreamworld. An album of dizzying beauty composed by Solar Fields as a one track story in twelve phases from nightscapes to the sky. Deep and addictive.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4bdfc0cc334f51eb64b392357b57d782acc268c5","amp;dn":"Solar+Fields+-+Until+We+Meet+the+Sky","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4bdfc0cc334f51eb64b392357b57d782acc268c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,223,192,204,51,79,81,235,100,179,146,53,123,87,215,130,172,194,104,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
