Five years later it was all over. Forty years after the singer Jim Morrison was found dead in Paris and the group disbanded, one could drive from here to there, changing from one FM pop station to another, and be all but guaranteed to hear two, three, four Doors songs in an hourÃ¢â‚¬â€every hour. Whatever the demands in the music, they remained unsatisfied, in the largest sense unfinished, and absolutely alive. There have been many books on the Doors. This is the first to bypass their myth, their mystique, and the death cult of both Jim Morrison and the era he was made to personify, and focus solely on the music. It is a story untold; all these years later, it is a new story.\n\nKirkus Reviews\nThe veteran critic (Bob Dylan by Greil Marcus, 2010, etc.) turns his attention to one of the defining rock bands of the 1960s.\n\nOutside of the band's 1967 debut album, the Doors strike Marcus as a mediocrity. So why write about them? In part because the release of &quot;official bootleg&quot; albums of live Doors shows offer new perspectives for Marcus to consider. It may help to have 2003's Boot Yer Butt! handy as he sagely discusses the group deconstructing &quot;Light My Fire&quot; onstage in 1967, or the way &quot;The End&quot; messily collapsed live a year later. In those pieces, Marcus eagerly strips the Doors of the psychedelic clichÃƒÂ©s that have attached to them. A compulsion to debunk myths about the '60s drives much of this book: Sick of being called upon to opine romantically on Woodstock culture, Marcus hears the death of the Summer of Love dream in the Doors' music, the way its mood seemed to foreshadow the Manson murders and the Altamont tragedy. As ever, the author synthesizes a variety of works to make such points, and the connections aren't always clear or convincing. What &quot;Twentieth Century Fox&quot; has to do with pop artists like Roy Lichtenstein is no clearer at the end of one essay than it was at the beginning. But Marcus' enthusiasm is often infectious, as in his astonishment over his admiration for Oliver Stone's biopic or the way Thomas Pynchon's Inherent Viceharks back to Morrison's crazed vocals on &quot;L.A. Woman.&quot;\n\nAn honorable if sometimes clumsy attempt to put the Doors in their cultural place.\n\nPublishers Weekly\nMusic critic Marcus (Bob Dylan by Greil Marcus) offers a relentlessly beautiful and insightful evaluation of the music of the DoorsÃ¢â‚¬â€a fitting tribute on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of MorrisonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s death in 1971Ã¢â‚¬â€but also a complete rethinking of the DoorsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ work as an entire story that captures the 1960s as Ã¢â‚¬Å“a place, even as it is created, people know they can never really inhabit, and never escape.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ He begins with the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first album, The Doors, and offers a tribute to the power of the work as a whole, especially the lengthy and much-maligned Ã¢â‚¬Å“The End,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ to make Ã¢â‚¬Å“everything seems tentative, uncertain, unclear: thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the source of the songÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s power, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all-encompassing embrace of darkness, doom and dread.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ He argues that the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s second album, Strange Days, perfectly captured the end of the 1960s ideals: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Already in 1968 the Doors were performing not freedom but its disappearance.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ And he contrasts a fascinating range of official and bootleg live recordings of such hit singles as Ã¢â‚¬Å“Touch MeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to show that by 1970 Ã¢â‚¬Å“a war between the band and its audience was underway, a war whose weapons were contempt on both sides.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ This is an impressive tribute to Ã¢â‚¬Å“the revolt the Doors momentarily embodied, and acted out,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ as well as to Jim MorrisonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s artistic attempt to move beyond the hatred he felt for the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pop success.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce135c1cdf0eafd1843e6ed188223954d237fd21","amp;dn":"Greil+Marcus+-+The+Doors-+A+Lifetime+of+Listening+to+Five+Mean+Y","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce135c1cdf0eafd1843e6ed188223954d237fd21","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,19,92,28,223,14,175,209,132,62,110,209,136,34,57,84,210,55,253,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
