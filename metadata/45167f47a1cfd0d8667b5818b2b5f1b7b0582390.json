I will be more than happy if you could leave me some feedback at comments !\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:45167f47a1cfd0d8667b5818b2b5f1b7b0582390","amp;dn":"Francesco+Lettera+vol.+01+-+05+%2B+Other+Works+%5B.flac%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"45167f47a1cfd0d8667b5818b2b5f1b7b0582390","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,22,127,71,161,207,208,216,102,123,88,24,178,181,241,183,176,88,35,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
