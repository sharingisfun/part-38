Shot in the Atlas Mountains of Morocco,\nHopper delivers a powerful performance. Arty as you've never seen\nhim before, he puts advertising into perspective of popular culture\nat the end of the 20th century.\nSpitting colour, laughing his head off, destroying books,\nDennis Hopper sends Hermann Vaske on a mission to talk to the\ngreatest ad men, directors and artists to find out about the\ncrossover between various creative disciplines.\nIn a visually dazzling, wickedly funny slam of creativity and\nmedia obsession, Hermann conducts unconventional kinds of\ninterviews.\n\n=======\n\nA documentary film talking about art and advertising divided in three parts:\n\n1. Crossing Over - from cinema to ads from ads to cinema\n\n2. Humour - How humour affects us in advertising\n\n3. Shock - The way shock is used to sell\n\n=======\n\nRuntime : 01:55:29\nDirector : Hermann Vaske\nWriter : Hermann Vaske\nStars : Jon Amiel, Rowan Atkinson, Sandra Bernhard, David Bowie,\n        John Cleese, Abel Ferrera, Anthony Hopkins, Dennis Hopper,\n        Tony Kaye, Harvey Keitel, Spike Lee, et al.\n\n=======\n\nVideo : Xvid | 640x480 | 1255Kbps | 29.97fps\nAudio : AC3 | 192Kbps | 2 Chan | cbr | 48KHz\n\n=======\n\n6 Screens : &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://imgur.com/a/L1YGs#0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://imgur.com/a/L1YGs#0&lt;/a&gt;\n\n=======\n\nAlternate :\nmagnet:?xt=urn:btih:22BD396F34382174F7D8122C1F2866E6D9751536\n\n=======\n\nEnjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22bd396f34382174f7d8122c1f2866e6d9751536","amp;dn":"The+Fine+Art+of+Separating+People+From+Their+Money+-+1998+-+VHS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22bd396f34382174f7d8122c1f2866e6d9751536","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,189,57,111,52,56,33,116,247,216,18,44,31,40,102,230,217,117,21,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
