Born May 19, 1952, in Kingston, Jamaica,\nJones studied theater at Syracuse University before launching a career as a model. Jones'\nstatuesque and flamboyant look proved to be a hit in the New York City nightclub scene, which\nled to a recording contract with Island Records in 1977. While such disco-based albums as 1977's\nPortfolio, 1978's Fame, and 1979's Muse failed to break the singer commercially, Jones soon amassed\na substantial following amongst gay men with her sexually charged live show, leading to her title at the\ntime of &quot;Queen of the Gay Discos.&quot;\n\nBut with the dawn of the '80s came a massive anti-disco movement across the U.S., leading to Jones\nfocusing on more new wave and experimental-based work resulting in two of her best-known and\nstrongest releases -- 1980's Warm Leatherette and 1981's Nightclubbing -- both produced by the noted\nreggae team of Sly &amp; Robbie (the latter release spawned one of Jones' biggest hits, &quot;Pull Up to the Bumper,&quot;\nas well as covers of Iggy Pop's &quot;Nightclubbing&quot; and the Police's &quot;Demolition Man&quot;). It was also around this\ntime that Jones changed her look to suit the times by replacing her S&amp;M look of the '70s with a detached,\nandrogynous image. Jones' sixth solo release overall, Living My Life, followed in 1982, while the singer\ntook a break from recording to focus on film work and landed roles in such movies as Conan the Destroyer\nand the James Bond flick A View to a Kill (Jones' romantic life also provided tabloid fodder at the time when\nshe was linked with Rocky IV star Dolph Lundgren).\n\nJones eventually returned back to her recording career, enlisting super-producer Trevor Horn\n(Frankie Goes to Hollywood) to oversee 1985's Slave to the Rhythm, which turned out to be a somewhat\nautobiographical work (the same year, a ten-track compilation was issued as well, Island Life). Jones' penchant\nfor working with big-name producers continued on 1986's Inside Story; with production chores handled by Chic's\nNile Rodgers, the album spawned one of Jones' last successful singles, &quot;I'm Not Perfect (But I'm Perfect for You).&quot;\nAfter 1989's Bulletproof Heart, Jones seemed to turn her back on her recording career (although 1993 saw the\nrelease of a new single, &quot;Sex Drive&quot;), as she again focused primarily on movies, including a role in Eddie Murphy's\nhit 1992 comedy Boomerang. The double-disc set Private Life: The Compass Point Sessions\n(a collection of 26 tracks that Jones recorded with Sly &amp; Robbie during their early '80s union) was released in 1998,\nwhich was followed up four years later with Island Life, Vol. 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSingle Review (c/o Discogs)\n\nThis was a reissue of this classic 80's track, with new remixes by Dancin' Danny D.\nAlso included is the Blooded mix from the original 12&quot; release from 1985, mixed by Trevor Horn.\nZTT records re-released this as a 2 CD set in 1994, with this cd being CD 1 which is pretty rare\nto track down nowadays. Danny D uses some of the original elements, strings etc to great effect\non the intro before he brings his own into it, working grace's strong vocal rather well.\n\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nGrace Jones - Slave to the Rhythm (Maxi Single)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nArtist...............................: Grace Jones\nAlbum..........: Slave to the Rhythm (Maxi Single)\nGenre.........................: Rock / Pop / Disco\nSource........................................: CD\nYear........................................: 1994\n\nRipper: Exact Audio Copy V1.0 b1 &amp; HP DVD RW AD-7701H\n\nCodec...........: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion.........: reference libFLAC 1.2.1 20070917\nQuality.......: Lossless, (avg. compression: 62 %)\nChannels..............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\nTags...............................: VorbisComment\n\nInformation..: Original 1994 UK CD Maxi Single\n\nRipped by..............: BSW on 7/15/2011\nPosted by..............: BSW on 7/15/2011\nNews Server...........: news.astraweb.com\n\nNews Group(s).: alt.binaries.sounds.mp3.metal.full.albums\n\nIncluded....: NFO, SFV, M3U, LOG, CUE\nCovers................: Front Back CD\n\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n1.
