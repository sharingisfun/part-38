Vilka var dessa mÃƒÂ¤n och hur pÃƒÂ¥verkade det dem att utfÃƒÂ¶ra avrÃƒÂ¤ttningarna?\n\n---\n\nEpisode 1 - Hangman\n\nThis is the story of The Private ExecutionersÃ¢â‚¬Â¦a unique history of British capital punishment, seen through the eyes of those who dispensed it. Though the hangmanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s duties were grim, their experiences encompassed pathos, passion and even genuine humor. The program asks: How were hangmen selected? How were they trained? How much responsibility did they bear? Finally, did the hangmen ever believe they had executed the innocent?\n\n---\n\nEpisode 2 - Dynasties of Death\n\nThe story of the French Ã¢â‚¬ËœbourreauÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is perhaps the most remarkable in the history of judicial executions. Nowhere were executioners more shunned than in France. Since they were carrying out the KingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s work, by divine right, they were seen as mystical figures. Holy but unclean. It was nigh impossible for them to carry out any other trade. They were often forced to live outside town and city walls. Tradesmen refused to serve them. The only prospect of marriage was to marry into another.\n\n---\n\nEpisode 3 - States of Death\n\nIn Britain it was the rope. In France; the guillotine. But in its short history the United States of America has experimented with a bewildering array of execution methodsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦.And continues to do so. This programme examines the history of the five principal methods: Hanging, Firing Squad, Electric Chair, Gas Chamber and Lethal Injection.\n\n---\n\nFile\nBÃƒÂ¶dlarna - Del 1 till 3.avi\nStorlek\n1,53 GB (1Ã‚Â 648Ã‚Â 528Ã‚Â 986 byte)\nLÃƒÂ¤ngd\n02:41:04\nDemuxer\navi\n\nKlippinfo\nMjukvara\nLavf55.16.102\n\nVideo\nUpplÃƒÂ¶sning\n640 x 362\nBildformat\n1.768\nFormat\nXVID\nBitar/sek\n1234 kbps\nBildrutor/sekund\n25.000\nVald codec\nffodivx\n\nInitialljudstrÃƒÂ¶m\nFormat\n85\nBitar/sek\n128 kbps\nFrekvens\n44100 Hz\nKanaler\n2\nVald codec\nffmp3float","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d67017947f3ec2c637bb1ea2c2436edf4b0c26d","amp;dn":"B%26ouml%3Bdlarna%2FThe+Executioners+-+2008+-+SweSub.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d67017947f3ec2c637bb1ea2c2436edf4b0c26d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,103,1,121,71,243,236,44,99,123,177,234,44,36,54,237,244,176,194,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
