While offering realistic fixed wing AI aircraft, Flight Simulator does not natively support AI helicopters. There are a few add-on AI helicopters available, but they all take off, fly and land like airplanes.\n\nHeli Traffic 2009 is the first Flight Simulator add-on that adds realistic AI helicopters that take off and land vertically, fly like helicopters and use helipads and not runways. This innovative product brings it's own AI engine that fully controls AI helicopters, instead of relying on FS to fly them. This allows a much greater degree of control, which translates into a realistic helicopter flight behavior.\n\nHeli Traffic 2009 uses airport helipads for takeoffs and landings. Both stock and add-on airports are recognized. You can also define additional helicopter landing spots from within the program. Or you can add helipads to your airport with our Airport Facilitator X product - and Heli Traffic\n2009 will automatically recognize and use these helipads.\n\nFor each helipad, you can set a few parameters like the helipad name, the desired traffic density, average parking times and the approach slope.\n\nHeli Traffic 2009 generates random and scheduled helicopter traffic. For random traffic, you simply set the desired number of movements at individual helipads. Heli Traffic 2009 will plan and execute helicopter flights that match your settings at each helipad in the best way possible.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e91984e51c3d2301a72f5db2909190742eb650a","amp;dn":"%5BFS9%2FFSX%5D+-+Flight1+-+Helitraffic+2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e91984e51c3d2301a72f5db2909190742eb650a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,145,152,78,81,195,210,48,26,114,245,219,41,9,25,7,66,235,101,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
