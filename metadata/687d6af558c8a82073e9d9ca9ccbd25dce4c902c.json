As the scientists begin experimentation on some chicks, the substance is misused by some Ã¢â‚¬Å“country folkÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ who donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t take it seriously and soon Herakleophorbia IV is running rampant throughout England and then across the globe, creating giant plants and animals that wreak havoc on the land and then the people. Then the first giant babies are revealed and for the first time humanity has to contend with the existence of a new race of giant people. How humanity deals with this shocking new creation is revealed in The Food of the Gods and How it Came to Earth.\n\nH. G. Wells was a writer, born in Bromley, Kent. He was apprenticed to a draper, tried teaching, studied biology in London, then made his mark in journalism and literature. He played a vital part in disseminating the progressive ideas which characterized the first part of the 20th-c. He achieved fame with scientific fantasies such as The Time Machine (1895) and War of the Worlds (1898), and wrote a range of comic social novels which proved highly popular, notably Kipps (1905) and The History of Mr Polly (1910). Both kinds of novel made successful (sometimes classic) early films. A member of the Fabian Society, he was often engaged in public controversy, and wrote several socio-political works dealing with the role of science and the need for world peace, such as The Outline of History (1920) and The Work, Wealth and Happiness of Mankind","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:687d6af558c8a82073e9d9ca9ccbd25dce4c902c","amp;dn":"The+Food+of+the+Gods+and+How+It+Came+to+Earth+by+H+G+Wells+%5Brepu","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"687d6af558c8a82073e9d9ca9ccbd25dce4c902c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,125,106,245,88,200,168,32,115,233,217,202,156,203,210,93,206,76,144,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
