Give your creativity a kick start by using an application that's actually designed to help you think. It's like having an extra brain - one that doesn't keep losing the car keys.\n\nYou can use OmniOutliner's document structure to create hierarchies of main headings and subpoints that can be expanded and collapsed, which are immensely useful when it comes to brainstorming new ideas, drilling out specifics, and lining up steps needed to get everything done. But you aren't limited to outlines - you've got multiple columns, smart checkboxes, customizable popup lists, and an ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼ber-innovative styles system at your disposal.\n\nUse OmniOutliner to draft to-do lists, create agendas, manage tasks, track expenses, take notes, plan events, write screenplaysÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ and just about anything else you can think of.\n\nIt's a smarter way to write, a more productive way to stay organized. Whatever your project, OmniOutliner has the tools you need to get the job done.\n\nFeatures\n\nStyles\n\nStyles are the visual elements that define the look of your documents: your type face choices, row colors, column background images, and so on. OmniOutliner helps you format on the fly with a super-powerful new Styles system designed to give you everything you need to apply style changes - from one word at a time to document wide.\n\nMultiple Column Types\n\nHere's where OmniOutliner really stands apart from other outliners, word processors, or even spreadsheet applications. You can create documents with multiple columns that contain different types of information - like pop-up lists, checkboxes, numerical values, dates, durations, or just plain text. Columns can even dynamically calculate sums for you, or produce averages.\n\nAttachments\n\nWhether you're creating a grocery list, marketing budget, or an exhaustive analysis of the mating habits of kangaroo mice, sometimes text just isn't enough. Your OmniOutliner documents can include images, sound files (you can even record audio directly into your document with OmniOutliner Professional), movies, web links, and links to files or applications on your computer.\n\nExport Options\n\nYour OmniOutliner documents can be exported as plain text, rich text, OPML, HTML, or you can write your own custom export plugins. OmniOutliner Professional's HTML-exported web pages allow you to expand and collapse items in a browser, and include all of your document's styles. Snazzy! Your outlines can also be turned into presentations by exporting to Apple's Keynote format.\n\nAppleScript Support\n\nCreate AppleScript shortcuts for complicated tasks, or automate the things you do over and over; you'll get more done, and with fewer mistakes. OmniOutliner can also interact with any other AppleScriptable program, so you could, say, create an AppleScript to take a list of actions and dates from OmniOutliner and draw a calendar of them in OmniGraffle (you have heard of that tasty diagramming program OmniGraffle, right?).\n\nBatch Find\n\nNow there's a handy new feature for when you need to find a specific word or phrase in your outline. Type in your search word, and OmniOutliner searches your whole outline at once. All of the matching results will show up in the Utility drawer and update with each letter you type, so you get results immediately.\n\nInline Notes\n\nYou asked for it, you got it: notes can now be displayed right beneath the items they're associated with, so you can see all of your notes without having to select each item in turn. If you prefer the old way, you can still choose to view notes in a pane at the bottom of the window. It's up to you!\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\nOS X.4.8 to snow leopard\n\n--&gt;&gt; PLEASE SEED &lt;&lt;--\n\n.pdf manual included\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a745b941488f7ac1ea2d25b07c3676f263e70030","amp;dn":"OmniOutliner+Pro+3.9.5+%2B+sn","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a745b941488f7ac1ea2d25b07c3676f263e70030","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,69,185,65,72,143,122,193,234,45,37,176,124,54,118,242,99,231,0,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
