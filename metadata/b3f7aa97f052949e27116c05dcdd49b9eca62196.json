Written for upper-level undergraduate and graduate students, it is the only textbook to integrate genetic, archaeological, and linguistic perspectives on human evolution, and to offer a genomic perspective, reflecting the shift from studies of specific regions of the genome towards comprehensive genomewide analyses of human genetic diversity.\nHuman Evolutionary Genetics is suitable for courses in Genetics, Evolution, and Anthropology. Those readers with a background in anthropology will find that the streamlined genetic analysis material contained in the Second Edition is more accessible. The new edition also integrates new technologies (including next-generation sequencing and genome-wide SNP typing) and new data analysis methods, including recent data on ancient genomes and their impact on our understanding of human evolution. The book also examines the subject of personal genomics and its implications.\n\nAbout the Authors\nMark Jobling is a Professor in the Department of Genetics at the University of Leicester, UK. .\nEd Hollox is a Lecturer in the Department of Genetics at the University of Leicester, UK.\nMatthew Hurles is a Senior Group Leader in Human Genetics at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Hinxton, UK.\nToomas Kivisild is a Reader in the Department of Archaeology and Anthropology, University of Cambridge, UK.\nChris Tyler-Smith heads the Human Evolution team at The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Hinxton, UK.\n\nCONTENTS\nchapter 1 An Introduction to Human Evolutionary Genetics 1\nchapter 2 Organization and Inheritance of the Human Genome 17\nchapter 3 Human Genome Variation 43\nchapter 4 Finding and Assaying Genome Diversity 95\nchapter 5 Processes Shaping Diversity 133\nchapter 6 Making Inferences from Diversity 167\nchapter 7 Humans as Apes 225\nchapter 8 What Genetic Changes Have Made Us Human? 257\nchapter 9 Origins of Modern Humans 283\nchapter 10 The Distribution of Diversity 319\nchapter 11 The Colonization of the Old World and Australia 341\nchapter 12 Agricultural Expansions 363\nchapter 13 Into New-Found Lands 409\nchapter 14 What Happens When Populations Meet 443\nchapter 15 Understanding the Past, Present, and Future\nof Phenotypic Variation 477\nchapter 16 Evolutionary Insights into Simple Genetic Diseases 517\nchapter 17 Evolution and Complex Diseases 541\nchapter 18 Identity and Identification 571\nappendix 601\nglossary 609\nIndex 641 \n\ncover   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://s10.postimg.org/nsnqymryx/Human_Evolutionary_Genetics.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://s10.postimg.org/nsnqymryx/Human_Evolutionary_Genetics.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b3f7aa97f052949e27116c05dcdd49b9eca62196","amp;dn":"Human+Evolutionary+Genetics+%282nd+Ed%29%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b3f7aa97f052949e27116c05dcdd49b9eca62196","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,247,170,151,240,82,148,158,39,17,108,5,220,221,73,185,236,166,33,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
