The mono album, available in multiple formats but most commonly as a two-CD set, consists of 56 songs and 13 tracks of dialogue; 30 of the songs had never been issued previously by The Beatles. It was the first official release by The Beatles of previously unissued performances since The Beatles at the Hollywood Bowl in 1977, and the first containing previously unreleased songs since Let It Be in 1970. Although the songs were recorded ahead of broadcast, allowing for retakes and occasional overdubbing, they are essentially &quot;live in studio&quot; performances. Most of the songs are cover versions of material from the late 1950s and early 1960s, reflecting the stage set they developed before Beatlemania. Before the album's release, comprehensive collections of The Beatles' BBC performances had become available on bootlegs.\n\nCD-01 - Track Listings\n\n[01] Beatle Greetings (Speech)\n[02] From Us To You\n[03] Riding On A Bus (Speech)\n[04] I Got A Woman\n[05] Too Much Monkey Business\n[06] Keep Your Hands Off My Baby\n[07] I'll Be On My Way\n[08] Young Blood\n[09] A Shot Of Rhythm And Blues\n[10] Sure To Fall (In Love With You)\n[11] Some Other Guy\n[12] Thank You Girl\n[13] Sha La La La La!
