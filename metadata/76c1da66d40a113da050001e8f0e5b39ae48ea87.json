Kessel is heard unaccompanied on two ballads (the Beatles' &quot;Yesterday&quot; and his own &quot;In the Garden of Love&quot;), he performs &quot;Laura&quot; in a trio with bassist Kenny Baldock and drummer Johnny Richardson, plays three songs with a quartet also featuring pianist Brian Lemon, uses a quintet on &quot;Bridging the Blues&quot; which also co-stars tenor saxophonist Danny Moss and, for an encore, has a duet with violinist Stephane Grappelli on a delightful version of &quot;Tea for Two.&quot; This well-rounded set features Barney Kessel in prime form and is easily recommended to his fans.
