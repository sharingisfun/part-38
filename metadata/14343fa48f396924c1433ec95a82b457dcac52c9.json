Singer/guitarist Gary Louris was injured in a car accident and left the band. Their manager was able to interest Twin/Tone Records in releasing the demos. Louris went to the studio to overdub his guitar parts and ended up re-joining the band. The re-mixed demos were released as Blue Earth.[1]\n\n&quot;Martin's Song&quot; and &quot;Two Angels&quot; were later re-recorded on Hollywood Town Hall.\n\nBlue Earth was re-issued on CD on the Rykodisc label in 2003 with three bonus tracks\n\nAll songs written by Mark Olson except as noted.\n\n&quot;Two Angels&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:07 \n&quot;She's Not Alone Anymore&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:23 \n&quot;Will I Be Married&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:53 \n&quot;Dead End Angel&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:40 \n&quot;Commonplace Streets&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:21 \n&quot;Ain't No End&quot; (Olson, Greg Louris, Marc Perlman) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:45 \n&quot;Five Cups of Coffee&quot; (Olson, Louris) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:52 \n&quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; (Olson, Louris) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:10 \n&quot;Red Firecracker&quot; (Louris, Olson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:08 \n&quot;Sioux City&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:11 \n&quot;I'm Still Dreaming, Now I'm Yours&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:45 \n&quot;Martin's Song&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:31 \nBonus tracks on 2003 re-issue:\n\n&quot;Fingernail Moon&quot; \n&quot;Two Minute Pop Song&quot; \n&quot;Nightshade&quot; \n\n[edit] Personnel\nMark Olson ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ vocals, guitar, harmonica \nGary Louris ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ vocals, guitar \nMarc Perlman ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ electric and acoustic bass \nThad Spencer ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ drums \nAdditional musicians:\n\nDan Gaarder ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ lead guitar (on &quot;Ain't No End&quot;, &quot;Five Cups of Coffee&quot;, &quot;Dead End Angel&quot;) \nCharlie Pine ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ organ (on &quot;Sioux City&quot;) \nNorm Rogers ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ vocals (on &quot;Sioux City&quot;) \nJim Doninelli ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ vocals (on &quot;Red Firecracker&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14343fa48f396924c1433ec95a82b457dcac52c9","amp;dn":"the+jayhawks...Blue+Earth%281989%29%5BFLAC%5D---DICKTHESPIC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14343fa48f396924c1433ec95a82b457dcac52c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,52,63,164,143,57,105,36,193,67,62,201,90,130,180,87,220,172,82,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
