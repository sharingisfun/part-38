His grandfather's death has just cut him of from the only life he has ever imagined. Abandoned by his parents' troubles, heading over the border seems the only way out of a society moving in all of the wrong directions so, with his friend Rawlins, he rides away. Soon enough, they acquire a hapless younger companion and jobs breaking horses on a hacienda. Within months, one of the boys is dead and childhood has passed for the other two, along with an era that once uniquely defined America. &quot;All the Pretty Horses&quot; is indisputably a timeless masterpiece. \n\nRead by Alexander Adams \n\n8 hours, 46 minutes from 7 Audio CDs at 160 kbps in MP3 format.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9cbe421deadc7d04adee0823ecdf941d6bc20e36","amp;dn":"Cormac+McCarthy+-+All+The+Pretty+Horses","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9cbe421deadc7d04adee0823ecdf941d6bc20e36","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,190,66,29,234,220,125,4,173,238,8,35,236,223,148,29,107,194,14,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
