We have just finished what is hopefully a proper update to support the Vengeance DLC (DLC5, according to the playlist file) on private games.\n\nYou can download it from the infohash 5777990027878C68635E825D041E570E75D20AD7. It requires the previous release as well.\n\nThere is still no ETA for when public games/dedicated servers will be implemented, however a new version of the Operation2 site is upcoming, which will feature modifications for both the first Black Ops as well as future releases for T6M.\n\nNote that this update may be crashing more than the previous one, but it should be at least allowing you to play. Also note that Zombies now can not be launched using t6mp.exe Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Treyarch removed the code allowing mode switching in this build, presumably because of us using it against their intent. :)\n\nIn addition, anyone spreading the rumor that Ã¢â‚¬ËœSKIDROWÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ updates are needed for T6M is a complete idiot, and should be shot on sight.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5777990027878c68635e825d041e570e75d20ad7","amp;dn":"T6M.Client-Operation2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5777990027878c68635e825d041e570e75d20ad7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,119,153,0,39,135,140,104,99,94,130,93,4,30,87,14,117,210,10,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
