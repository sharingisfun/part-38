Inspired by both grotesque and humanist models, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s clean and prudent with a warm, friendly tone.\n\nAlright Sans is a modest design that doesn't feel at all stiff or bland. It has open apertures and roundabout economy that works exceptionally well across media and at reduced sizes. And with shorter-than-normal capitals and a tall x-height, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s functional without becoming distracting, goofy, or unprofessional.\nExtra care was taken in creating the OpenType features in Alright Sans. Details were included to help make high-quality typesetting easier, such as case-sensitive punctuation and an optically-correct superscript. A stylistic set in the italics provides alternate two-story forms of the Ã¢â‚¬ËœaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and Ã¢â‚¬ËœgÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. Even the default numbers are the proportional width old-style forms for a more refined all-around text appearance. There are also lining figures for setting with caps and tabular-width versions for setting tables.\n\nEvery style of Alright Sans also has a full set of built-in small caps, even the italics. There is also an expanded character set, supporting over a hundred languages. And with weights ranging from extra thin to ultra heavy, Alright Sans proves itself to be a versatile and useful family for a wide range of projects.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad5c5ca3ca36761775f3a73c4a7da582e84970bc","amp;dn":"Alright+Sans+Font+%7B%3DIMPAVIDUS%3D%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ad5c5ca3ca36761775f3a73c4a7da582e84970bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,92,92,163,202,54,118,23,117,243,167,60,74,125,165,130,232,73,112,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
