The group released its debut album, Christmas Eve and Other Stories, just in time for the 1996 holiday season. The Christmas Attic followed in 1998, and two years later the group issued its first non-seasonal recording, Beethoven's Last Night. In 2004, the band returned with the new album Lost Christmas Eve and collected all their Christmas recordings on the three-CD/one-DVD collection Christmas Trilogy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:37a95808b4da9e70358e6c5e0ba64af47ee3894a","amp;dn":"Trans-Siberian+Orchestra+-+The+Lost+Christmas+Eve","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"37a95808b4da9e70358e6c5e0ba64af47ee3894a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,169,88,8,180,218,158,112,53,142,108,94,11,166,74,244,126,227,137,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
