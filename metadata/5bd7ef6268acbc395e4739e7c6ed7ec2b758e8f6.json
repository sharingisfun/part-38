This interaction has led to the formation of many unique features over the Antarctic continent. Antarctica is now emerging as an important key in the understanding of global and environmental concerns. Its unique features have provided scientists with special opportunities to investigate the origin of the continents, pollution at the global level, ozone hole healing and changes in the global climate. However, lack of scientific data remains a major problem for researchers in many areas of Antarctic science. This book fills the gaps in the process of understanding Antarctic science.\n\n\n# Hardcover: 259 pages\n# Publisher: Nova Science Pub Inc (July 31, 2011)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 1611228158\n# ISBN-13: 978-1611228151","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5bd7ef6268acbc395e4739e7c6ed7ec2b758e8f6","amp;dn":"Antarctica-The+Most+Interactive+Ice-Air-Ocean+Environment+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5bd7ef6268acbc395e4739e7c6ed7ec2b758e8f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,215,239,98,104,172,188,57,94,71,57,231,198,237,126,194,183,88,232,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
