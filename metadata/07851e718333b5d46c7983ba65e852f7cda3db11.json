Written by Jack London; Full-cast dramatisation starring Jack Klaff, Kerry Shale and Shelley Thompson; Adapted by Ed Thomason; Directed by Adrian Bean.\n\nWhen Humphrey Van Weyden finds himself struggling in the freezing waters of San Francisco Bay, he thinks the worst that can happen to him is drowning. After he is rescued by the Ghost and its captain, Wolf Larson, Humphrey discovers that there are fates far worse than death.\n\nOn Larsen's hell-ship, the dilettante hero is forced to slave as cabin boy and humble seaman. Over the seven months' voyage to the sealing grounds off Siberia, he engages in an epic duel with his ruthlessly Nietzschean skipper, a conflict that must end with the death of one of them.
