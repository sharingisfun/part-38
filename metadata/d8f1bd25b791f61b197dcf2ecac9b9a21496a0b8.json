He is asked to keep track of his experiences through a blog. Suddenly so many of his experiences seem strange; the antiques dealer trying to buy his old tax papers, his neighbor boiling salamanders on his balcony at midnight, the super sexy lab assistant who falls for him but is unable to express herself in terms outside the realm of science. \n\nBut when one of the trial participants turns up dead and another goes missing, Gomez begins to fear for his life. No longer sure who he can trust and which of his experiences are real and which merely drug induced illusions, he decides itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s time to go underground and work out a devious plan.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d8f1bd25b791f61b197dcf2ecac9b9a21496a0b8","amp;dn":"Clash+of+the+Sissies+-+Kindle+book+-+comedy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d8f1bd25b791f61b197dcf2ecac9b9a21496a0b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,241,189,37,183,145,246,27,25,125,207,46,202,201,185,162,20,150,160,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
