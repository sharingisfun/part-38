In the course of embryonic development, stem cells generate all the specialized cells that populate body tissues like muscle, the nervous system, and blood. In adults, reserves of stem cells repair and regenerate tissues damaged by disease and wounding. Because of the potential of stem cells to generate fresh, healthy cells, there is a huge interest in cultivating them to treat various diseases. This year's Holiday Lectures will explore exciting progress toward the goal of harnessing stem cells to treat diabetes, nerve damage, and heart disease.\r\n\r\nVideo\r\nFormat: MKV\r\nFrame Size: 720 x 480\r\nBitrate: 3725 kbps\r\nFrame Rate: 29.97fps\r\n\r\nAudio\r\nAudio Codec: AC3\r\nRate and Size: 48000 HZ 16 bit\r\nBitrate: 192 kbps\r\nChannel: 2","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:038b26726e9c13bc54b2fa830d5a7601e04e16e0","amp;dn":"HHMI.Potent+Biology+-+Stem+Cells%2C+Cloning%2C+and+Regeneration+MKV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"038b26726e9c13bc54b2fa830d5a7601e04e16e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,139,38,114,110,156,19,188,84,178,250,131,13,90,118,1,224,78,22,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
