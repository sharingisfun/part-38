Not only is it a good profile of a &quot;functional&quot; alcoholic, but the pain his family feels is visceral. The end of the episode, truly devastating. You want the best for Bret, but you know Bret doesn't want the best for himself. Season 7, Episode 7, the saddest Intervention ever.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:343713dfad00478c43a36f762fa82d4ad287619b","amp;dn":"Intervention+S07E07+-+Bret","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"343713dfad00478c43a36f762fa82d4ad287619b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,55,19,223,173,0,71,140,67,163,111,118,47,168,45,74,210,135,97,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
