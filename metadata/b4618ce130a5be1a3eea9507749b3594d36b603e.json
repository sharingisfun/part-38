Equally known\nfor their sweeping sound as for their grandiose statements about politics and\nreligion, they are rock and roll crusaders, who have undoubtedly influenced\ngenerations of bands. &amp;#039;U218 Singles&amp;#039; is their latest greatest hits album, a\ncareer-spanning collection of 16 songs, and two new tracks, including their\nnew single, &amp;#039;The Saints Are Coming&amp;#039;, a collaboration with Green Day released\nas part of Hurricane Katrina charity Music Rising.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b4618ce130a5be1a3eea9507749b3594d36b603e","amp;dn":"U2-U218_Singles-2006-RNS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b4618ce130a5be1a3eea9507749b3594d36b603e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,97,140,225,48,165,190,26,62,234,149,7,116,155,53,148,211,107,96,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
