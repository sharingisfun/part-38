The two warring families are headed by the           \n         stunning and willful Charlotte Kensington and the            \n         ruthless stunning Taylor Cane.                               \n                                                                      \n           These are people driven by greed, by lust, by              \n         revenge, and by Charles the chauffeur.                       \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n                                                    \n                     \n                 \n                          \n                                \n                                                \n                               RIP NOTES                              \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n           Carol Burnett is somewhat of a legend in                   \n         entertainment, and in this 80s comedy miniseries             \n         she plays the widowed matriarch of the Kensingtons,          \n         a once wealthy raisin-growing family in Fresno,              \n         California. Aired in 1986, this was very clearly             \n         a parody of the prime time megasoaps of the day,             \n         such as Falcon Crest and Dynasty, which captured             \n         the eyes of most of the Western world on a weekly            \n         basis. While Fresno may have shared the same setting         \n         and basic premise, it was a total sendup, and a              \n         funny one at that. While Carol Burnett had relied            \n         more heavily on oneliners in her previous work,              \n         this was more of a plot-driven parody, and one               \n         that worked quite well in our opinion! Look out              \n         for a brief appearance by Michael Richards, best             \n         known to later audiences as Cosmo Kramer, playing            \n         a hitman who should rather have looked for a                 \n         different day job.                                           \n                                                                      \n           This rip comes from the only known release of the          \n         series, the UK PAL VHS. While the original series            \n         came in 5 episodes, the VHS release was split into           \n         two installments. These tapes used the original              \n         uncut broadcast version, and not the later                   \n         shortened version with an added (and totally                 \n         unnecessary) laugh track.                                    \n                                     Enjoy!                           \n                                                                      \n                                                    \n                     \n                 \n                          \n                                \n                                                \n                               WHO WE ARE                             \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n           Since 2003, FLAiR has been dedicated to preserving         \n         the neglected titles of an entertainment era long gone.      \n         A time of classic kids flicks, painstaking hand-drawn        \n         animation and countless cheesy low-budget horrors. A         \n         time when pop had a King, and rock had a Queen. A time       \n         when special FX wizards ruled, and CGI was just one of       \n         their many tools.                                            \n                                                                      \n           Driven by nostalgia and memories of better days, we        \n         seek to relive those times, and share those memories.        \n         While our belief is that the 80s represent the very          \n         pinnacle of pop culture, we will not limit ourselves         \n         to one decade, or any single genre. We will not ignore       \n         the movies considered insignificant or even embarrassing     \n         by the studios. We will not disregard a timepiece just       \n         because it is dated.                                         \n                                                                      \n           Whereas most groups rely solely on digital sources,        \n         there are still thousands of rare and out of print           \n         titles, many of which have no planned digital release.       \n         We've made it our mission to dig these out, clean them       \n         up using the best hardware and techniques available to       \n         us, and share them with the world. Be it VHS, Laserdisc      \n         or more exotic formats, we're here to bring you the best     \n         (and worst!) of decades past. So sit back and enjoy as       \n         we uncover and pay tribute to an age of cinema we will       \n         never get back.                                              \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n                                                    \n                     \n                 \n                          \n                                \n                                                \n                                 THANKS                               \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n           To everyone that has supported us over the years and       \n         managed to keep this fun!                                    \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n            AEN  AEROHOLiCS  SChiZO  FLS  SiCK  BLooDWeiSeR           \n                                                                      \n            FiCO  TheWretched  VH-PROD  HUMANiSM  BLooDLiTE           \n                                                                      \n            EPiSODE  VoMiT  ALLiANCE  FRAGMENT  SAPHiRE  xV           \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n                                                    \n                     \n                  \n                           \n                                \n                      nFO: asphyx","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c09c1493843c03a6084d3289417059cc5bb875d5","amp;dn":"Fresno.Part.1.1986.VHSRip.XviD-FLAiR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c09c1493843c03a6084d3289417059cc5bb875d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,156,20,147,132,60,3,166,8,77,50,137,65,112,89,204,91,184,117,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
