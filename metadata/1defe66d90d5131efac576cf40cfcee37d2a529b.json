Enjoy!\n\n&quot;Well, what can I say... &quot;B&quot;-movie status would've been an IMPROVEMENT for this movie! I watched this one in fast forward, mostly, and didn't miss much, if anything at all. The only part worth watching was when they find the diary kept by his mother. At least it'll explain the plot which, by the way, is lame: This woman gets raped and takes up residence (from what I can tell) on the same island she was raped on. Her son ends up as a cross between Norman Bates and Frankenstein. He eats anything in site and apparently wasn't well-treated as a child because of his malformation.\n\nBut look on the bright side... you'll always have some dumb kids who just happen to be too nosy for their own good stumble on a DESERTED island (gee, how original *sigh*) and drink too much and start doing stuff they shouldn't.\n\nI think I'd have had more pity for the monster if he wasn't put in such dreary lighting conditions (how do you expect to be scared by something you can't see that well?!?!) The only thing I did enjoy from this film was the ending, because that meant it was over. Don't spend your money buying this one unless you can get it for $1.00 or less.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1defe66d90d5131efac576cf40cfcee37d2a529b","amp;dn":"Humongous+VHS%281982%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1defe66d90d5131efac576cf40cfcee37d2a529b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,239,230,109,144,213,19,30,250,197,118,207,64,207,206,227,125,42,82,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
