His brother Billy brutally murders an underage prostitute before surrendering to the Thai police. Lieutenant Chang Ã¢â‚¬â€œ known as the &quot;Angel of Death&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ arrives on the scene before informing the girl's father, Choi Yan Lee. Chang allows Choi to beat Billy to death, but cuts off the man's arm for allowing his young daughter to remain in the business of prostitution.\n\nJulian's mother, Crystal, arrives in Bangkok to identify Billy's corpse, much to Julian's surprise. Crystal implores Julian to find the men who killed Billy, but he refuses, infuriating her. Julian and his crew go to Choi's kiosk to confront him about his part in Billy's murder. Choi reveals that he was forced to kill Billy by the &quot;Angel of Death&quot;, and, by having his arm severed, has paid the price for his crime. Julian is mesmerized by the near-mythical Angel of Death and spares the man's life. Crystal demands that Julian kill the Angel of Death, but he again refuses.\n\nOne night, Julian brings a prostitute, Mai, to meet Crystal, who, however, immediately begins hurling insults at her and Julian. Meanwhile, Liang, one of the fighters at Julian's boxing club, assassinates Choi at the behest of Gordon, a member of Julian's crew. Julian finds out Gordon is responsible and tries to kill him, only to be interrupted by the arrival of police, including Chang. Chang concludes that Julian is not Choi's killer, and Julian realizes that Chang is the Angel of Death. Julian confronts Chang about his role in Billy's murder and challenges him to a fight in the ring.\n\n\nGeneral INFO :\n\nFormat                                   : Flash Video\nFile size                                : 505 MiB\nDuration                                 : 1h 29mn\nOverall bit rate                         : 788 Kbps\nWriting application                      : Encoded By\nTagging application                      : Yet Another Metadata Injector for FLV - Version 1.9\n\nVideo\n\nFormat                                   : AVC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile                           : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;5d15343a351d116e736d&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nFormat settings, CABAC                   : Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames                : 4 frames\nCodec ID                                 : 7\nDuration                                 : 1h 29mn\nBit rate                                 : 700 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 640 pixels\nHeight                                   : 352 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 16:9\nFrame rate mode                          : Constant\nFrame rate                               : 23.976 fps\nColor space                              : YUV\nChroma subsampling                       : 4:2:0\nBit depth                                : 8 bits\nScan type                                : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)                       : 0.130\nStream size                              : 439 MiB (87%)\nWriting library                          : x264 core 125 r2200 999b753\n\nAudio\n\nFormat                                   : AAC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat profile                           : LC\nCodec ID                                 : 10\nDuration                                 : 1h 29mn\nBit rate                                 : 94.4 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nChannel positions                        : Front: L R\nSampling rate                            : 44.1 KHz\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\nDelay relative to video                  : 19ms\nStream size                              : 64.4 MiB (13%)\n\n\n\n* enjoy ...\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3cef587c0bfa5d57da7bbd0614edfcbe42c027e","amp;dn":"Only+God+Forgives+2013+WEBRip.flv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3cef587c0bfa5d57da7bbd0614edfcbe42c027e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,206,245,135,192,191,165,213,125,167,187,208,97,78,223,203,228,44,2,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
