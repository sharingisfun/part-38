This was a period in the artist's development notable for\nlarge sculptures on a monumental scale and with a public theme. They helped establish\nMoore as the unrivalled international figure that he is today. These major works are\ncomprehensively illustrated, with a profusion of views and details and in certain cases photographs of earlier stages in their making.\n\nOver 160 illustrations are reproduced, and they include a section devoted to the sculptor's drawings which in many instances show his original conceptions for the sculptures","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:194665955f3f454a44dd7c249198e1d1e85a80d4","amp;dn":"Henry+Moore+-+Sculpture+and+Drawings+1949-1954+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"194665955f3f454a44dd7c249198e1d1e85a80d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,70,101,149,95,63,69,74,68,221,124,36,145,152,225,209,232,90,128,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
