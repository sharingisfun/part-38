The movie plus commentary audio track has been processed to make the movie closer in volume to the commentary. \r\n\r\nAudio track 1 is an unscripted riff commentary by the original MST3K performers:\r\nJoel Hodgson: s0-s5 Joel Robinson\r\nTrace Beaulieu: s0-s7 Dr Clayton Forrester, Crow T. Robot\r\nJosh Weinstein: s0-s1 Dr Laurence &quot;Larry&quot; Erhardt, Tom Servo\r\n\r\nThe Joel/Trace/Josh commentary runs for the entire theatrical cut of the movie from 3seconds in until 1sec before the end of the film. This is very much like season0 when they would watch MST3K movies for the first time and riff them on the fly.\r\n\r\nDirector Paul Feig: &quot;It's Josh Weinstein and Trace Beaulieu and Joel Hodgson doing it.  They just came in for one day.  They didn't even write it.  They just came in and did it as a favor with us for an hour or an hour and a half (laughs).&quot;\r\n\r\nPlease check out other MST3K, Rifftrax, Battlestar Galactica, Star Trek, Gotham, DC Comics, documentaries, and more at:\r\n  https://thepiratebay.org/user/bsg4you/  \r\n  https://kat.cr/user/bsg4you/uploads/  \r\nand leave any corrections, criticism, comments and requests.\r\n\r\nThanks, bsg4you","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4a4d4349c49dc5009f402fa161dadb4c5b42f06","amp;dn":"The+Heat+2013+1080p+Riffed-by-MST3K-Joel-Trace-Josh+6ch+2ch+x264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c4a4d4349c49dc5009f402fa161dadb4c5b42f06","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,164,212,52,156,73,220,80,9,244,2,250,22,29,173,180,197,180,47,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
