But upon his second exit from the band (shortly after the release of 2005's lukewarm The Unquestionable Truth, Pt. 1), Borland looked for his next project to be more musically varied, quirky, and unpredictable. No stranger to oddball side projects, Borland also sought something a bit more permanent, which led to the formation of Black Light Burns. \n\n  While some of the material had been demoed years earlier, it wasn't until Borland decided that he was going to pull double duty as the band's lead vocalist - and the enlistment of former Nine Inch Nails member Danny Lohner - that the project came to life. With Lohner supplying bass, Joshua Eustis playing keyboards, and studio vet Josh Freese keeping the beat, Black Light Burns recorded what was to become the group's debut full-length, 2007's Cruel Melody.\n\n  But with none of the other contributors willing to commit to touring in support of the album, Borland enlisted the aid of a whole new supporting cast for the road - including second guitarist Nick Annis, bassist Sean Fetterman, and drummer Marshall Kilpatric (the latter of whom is a former member of the Esoteric). The group's second studio album, The Moment You Realize You're Going to Fall, arrived in 2012.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:99bbbe879794da737501ed61b40d529760011247","amp;dn":"Black+Light+Burns+-+Lotus+Island+%282013%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"99bbbe879794da737501ed61b40d529760011247","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,187,190,135,151,148,218,115,117,1,237,97,180,13,82,151,96,1,18,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
