His notoriety as a heroin addict had also become legendary, and the New York police eventually withdrew his cabaret card (a requisite to working in New York nightclubs). Thereafter, he adopted a more itinerant lifestyle, playing with pick-up groups in Boston, Newark, Philadelphia, Chicago, and in California. His cabaret card was reinstated in 1953, but by then he was beset by sporadic employment, debt, and failing physical and mental health. He twice attempted suicide in 1954 and voluntarily committed himself to New York's Bellevue Hospital. His last public appearance was on March 5, 1955, at Birdland, the club named in his honor in 1949. A chronic abuser of drugs and alcohol, Parker died in 1955 at the age of 34.\n\nHis life formed the basis for Clint Eastwood's 1988 film ''Bird''.\n\nAll these songs are by Charlie Parker with the music Supervisor : Lennie Niehaus \n\nCharlie Parker - Bird - OST Tracks:\n01  Lester Leaps In\n02  I Can't Believe That You're in Love With Me\n03  Laura\n04  All of Me\n05  This Time the Dream's on Me\n06  Ko ko\n07  Cool Blues\n08  April in Paris\n09  Now's the Time\n10  Ornithology\n11  Parker's Mood","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b3e54e356f5ce9d7c426b84ed8557f7cc9c6a839","amp;dn":"Charlie+Parker+-+Bird+-+OST+%281988%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bmp3+320%5D%5Bh33t%5D%5Bschon55","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b3e54e356f5ce9d7c426b84ed8557f7cc9c6a839","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,229,78,53,111,92,233,215,196,38,184,78,216,85,127,124,201,198,168,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
