It was recorded in late 1972 after bassist Andy Fraser had left the band and while guitarist Paul Kossoff was ailing from an addiction to Mandrax (Quaaludes), and features a different line up from previous albums. Tetsu Yamauchi was brought in to replace Fraser, while John &quot;Rabbit&quot; Bundrick became the band's keyboard player to compensate for the increasingly unreliable Kossoff (singer Paul Rodgers played keyboards on the previous album Free at Last). Both Yamauchi and Bundrick had played with Kossoff and drummer Simon Kirke on the album Kossoff, Kirke, Tetsu &amp; Rabbit during that period in late 1971 when the band had broken up for the first time. Also, several other musicians were used on the album. The album was co-produced by Andy Johns as well as Free themselves.\n\nThe album was, by Free's standards, a huge success. It became their third top-ten album in the UK (reaching #9), and reached No. 47 in America, which was also a considerable success for the band. Also, the single release &quot;Wishing Well&quot; became their third-most successful single, reaching No. 7. It is widely regarded as one of their definitive songs.\n\nDespite the success of the album and impending tour of America, it finally became apparent that the band had passed the point of no return. Kossoff being credited as an additional musician came as a shock to the entire band.  Kossoff spiralled to his lowest ebb and was unable to go to America; he was replaced, for the tour, by Wendell Richardson from Osibisa, against Rodgers' instincts. Richardson proved (through no fault of his own) to be the wrong choice, and once the tour ended the band finally gave up. Rodgers and Kirke formed Bad Company with Mick Ralphs (formerly of Mott the Hoople) and Boz Burrell (formerly of King Crimson); Yamauchi joined the Faces; Bundrick became a session musician and eventually became a regular keyboard player with the Who; Kossoff formed his own band Back Street Crawler, which Bundrick joined in the later stages of the band. After two unsuccessful albums, the guitarist died of a heart attack on board an aeroplane on 19 March 1976, at the age of 25.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n    &quot;Wishing Well&quot; (Rodgers, Kirke, Yamauchi, Kossoff, Bundrick) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3.43\n    &quot;Come Together in the Morning&quot; (Rodgers) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4.38\n    &quot;Travellin' in Style&quot; (Rodgers, Kirke, Yamauchi, Kossoff, Bundrick) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4.01\n    &quot;Heartbreaker&quot; (Rodgers) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 6.12\n    &quot;Muddy Water&quot; (Bundrick) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4.15\n    &quot;Common Mortal Man&quot; (Bundrick) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4.06\n    &quot;Easy on My Soul&quot; (Rodgers) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3.44\n    &quot;Seven Angels&quot; (Rodgers) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5.03\n\nBonus Tracks\n\n    &quot;Wishing Well&quot; (US mix) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3.39\n    &quot;Let Me Show You&quot; (Single 'B' side)  Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3.01\n    &quot;Muddy Water&quot; (Alternative vocals) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4.15\n    &quot;Hand Me Down/Turn Me Round&quot; (Prospective album track) (Bundrick) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3.19\n    &quot;Heartbreaker&quot; (Rehearsal version) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5.40\n    &quot;Easy on My Soul&quot; (Rehearsal version) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 8.42\n\n\nFree:\n\n\n    Paul Rodgers Ã¢â‚¬â€œ lead vocals, guitar\n    Paul Kossoff Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitar\n    John &quot;Rabbit&quot; Bundrick Ã¢â‚¬â€œ backing vocals, keyboards\n    Tetsu Yamauchi Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass guitar\n    Simon Kirke Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums, guitar on 'Muddy Water'\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6cc60fd8408248fa94a349c925e99823469cc66","amp;dn":"Free+-+Heartbreaker+%5BRemaster-Expanded%5D+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6cc60fd8408248fa94a349c925e99823469cc66","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,204,96,253,132,8,36,143,169,74,52,156,146,94,153,130,52,105,204,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
