She's now her own singer. But it is still useful to talk about Kelli's work on the Pimps' *Becoming X* album, because that was when the world learned that she is a very unique singer with a fabulously sensual and sexy voice. The dark, moody feel of the Pimps' trip-hop brought out the serious side in Kelli's voice and highlighted all of her strengths. However, that's not the case with much of this solo album.\nMuch of the material here is basic sunny techno-pop that hardly brings out all of Kelli's great singing abilities. Songs like &quot;Inferno High Love,&quot; &quot;Here Comes the Summer,&quot; and &quot;Queen of the World&quot; are built on insipid pop melodies that wouldn't even challenge Britney Spears, much less someone who can truly sing. That's a real problem on at least half of this album, and unfocused songwriting is the culprit.\n\nWhen the music gets serious, especially in the second half of the album, that's when Kelli's abilities have room to roam. Some lowdown funk grooves pop up in &quot;Teardrop Hittin' the Ground&quot; and &quot;Beautiful Boy,&quot; to bring out Kelli's sly side. The dark and sensuous Kelli is heard best in the hidden bonus track &quot;Tigermouth.&quot; The guitar rocker &quot;Infinite Stars&quot; seems out of place but it allows Kelli to actually stretch out a bit, while the album's true winner in both the singing and songwriting departments is the dramatic &quot;Kids.&quot; This album is an acceptable showcase for a great singer, but she needs better material to challenge her abilities and bring out all of her strengths.
