The 12 songs here are all high quality, and they hit across a wide range of styles within bluegrass. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Standing By Your SideÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Southern StyleÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ are catchy, upbeat songs dominated by the banjo, while Ã¢â‚¬Å“Behind the BulletÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a minor-key stomper and Ã¢â‚¬Å“My HometownÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a great ballad. The high speed instrumental Ã¢â‚¬Å“AlleghenyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ shows off the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s considerable picking skills, as does the equally fast kiss off Ã¢â‚¬Å“Go to HellÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. The a cappella Ã¢â‚¬Å“Towing the ChainÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ demonstrates that the band can harmonize as well as they can play, and is just about the only place on the album where a sharp-eared listener can pick up a hint of Mustered CourageÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Aussie accents.\n\nThe dark lyrics, modern setting, and roots-rock feel of Ã¢â‚¬Å“PowerlinesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ shows that the band has more on their minds than just replicating traditional types of bluegrass songs. And while some may gripe that a bunch of Australians know nothing about southern hospitality or riding a steam train from Tennessee to New Orleans, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not like most modern American bluegrass acts have actually experienced those things, either. The bottom line is that Mustered Courage has the style, songwriting and chops to stand toe to toe with most of their American contemporaries, and Powerlines is worth a listen to bluegrass fans.\n\n\n \t\t00 album art 01.JPG\t                        82.35 KB\n \t\t01 Standing By Your Side.flac 44.1kHz 858kbps\t21.59 MB\n \t\t02 Cruel Alibis.flac 44.1kHz 804kbps\t        23.10 MB\n \t\t03 Behind The Bullet.flac 44.1kHz 856kbps\t26.78 MB\n \t\t04 My Hometown.flac 44.1kHz 784kbps\t        24.24 MB\n \t\t05 Allegheny.flac 44.1kHz 874kbps\t        19.77 MB\n \t\t06 Townin' The Chain.flac 44.1kHz 737kbps\t13.99 MB\n \t\t07 Southern Style.flac 44.1kHz 888kbps\t        21.62 MB\n \t\t08 Powerlines.flac 44.1kHz 877kbps\t        27.79 MB\n \t\t09 Go To Hell.flac 44.1kHz 872kbps\t        28.95 MB\n \t\t10 Miss My Ways.flac 44.1kHz 889kbps\t        21.98 MB\n \t\t11 Old Steam Train.flac 44.1kHz 867kbps\t        24.99 MB\n \t\t12 Still Shinin'.flac 44.1kHz 876kbps\t        16.16 MB\n \t\tMustered Courage - Powerlines.m3u\t          847 bytes\n \t\tPowerlines.cue\t                                 1.34 KB\n \t\tz. audiochecker main log file.log\t         2.75 KB\n \t\tz. audiochecker.log\t                          798 bytes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e59feb4af8cee9388bef0aa10ab7b7b7bf08b47","amp;dn":"Mustered+Courage+-+Powerlines+%28flac%29+%5BMentalZero%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e59feb4af8cee9388bef0aa10ab7b7b7bf08b47","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,89,254,180,175,140,238,147,136,190,240,170,16,171,123,123,123,240,139,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
