This is the 2001 series.\n\nClipped from Wikipedia: &lt;SPOILERS&gt; The second Suicide Squad volume was published in 2001 by Keith Giffen and Paco Medina. Though the group\\\\\\&amp;#039;s first issue featured members of Giffen\\\\\\&amp;#039;s \\\\\\&quot;Injustice League\\\\\\&quot; group as the Suicide Squad\\\\\\&amp;#039;s membership, the roster was promptly slaughtered save for Major Disaster and Multi-Man (whose powers make him unkillable). The two departed after their one and only mission, leading to Sgt. Rock to recruit new members, most of which died in the missions they went on.\n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1083c2636826208007d09365a1397b084a95a1ce","amp;dn":"Suicide+Squad+%282001%29+%28Catseye2001%29+%5Bh33t%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1083c2636826208007d09365a1397b084a95a1ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,131,194,99,104,38,32,128,7,208,147,101,161,57,123,8,74,149,161,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
