With his mother no longer able to afford his private Christian school, Hany is thrown into the culture shock of public school, where he's mistaken for Muslim and does nothing to dissuade his classmates, seeing it as an opportunity to fit in. A hilarious coming-of-age comedy that tackles social discrimination and satirizes the Egyptian education system, it's no wonder the script for EXCUSE MY FRENCH was held up by Egyptian censors for four years. Luckily for us, this warmly comic film now sees the light of day.\r\nMilwaukee Film Festival\r\n\r\nDIRECTOR: AMR SALAMA\r\nPRODUCERS: HADI EL BAGORY, MOHAMED HEFY, HANY OSAMA\r\nSCREENWRITER: AMR SALAMA\r\n\r\nVideo: MPEG4 (Matroska) Video (H264) 1080x480 (40:21) 25fps\r\nAudio: AAC 48000Hz stereo","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c519fd7bdde3ad744e61a8debf4d93ea30dca44","amp;dn":"Excuse+My+French+2014+Egyptian+1080X480p+h264+AAC+Mkv+Makalakato","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c519fd7bdde3ad744e61a8debf4d93ea30dca44","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,81,159,215,189,222,58,215,68,230,26,141,235,244,217,62,163,13,202,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
