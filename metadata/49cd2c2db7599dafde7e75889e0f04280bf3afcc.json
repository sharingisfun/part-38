It was an answer to a \n call by Commissariat gÃƒÂ©nÃƒÂ©ral aux cÃƒÂ©lÃƒÂ©brations 1534?1984 of the Quebec \n Government for the 450th anniversary celebration of the arrival of French \n explorer Jacques Cartier (1491?1557) to Canada. Gauthier, who left the company\n in 2001, now owns the ski area Le Massif, on the St. Lawrence River in Quebec.\n Cirque du Soleil is now &quot;guided&quot; by LalibertÃƒÂ©.\n\n  It has been described as the modern circus, and focuses upon a storyline as \n well as amazing performances. It has several resident and touring troupes and \n draws heavily from the circus tradition. Emphasizing the use of humans as \n performers, Cirque du Soleil does not make use of animals. Instead, its \n performances combine elements of street performances and busking, circus, \n opera, ballet, and rock music. Acts include contortionists, jugglers, feats \n of strength, clowning, and trapeze artists. Their costumes are very colorful. \n Cirque shows traditionally do not use pre-recorded music; with some exceptions \n all music is played live, and in many performances the spoken parts are done \n in Cirquish, an imaginary language invented by the company.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:49cd2c2db7599dafde7e75889e0f04280bf3afcc","amp;dn":"Cirque+du+Soleil+reload","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"49cd2c2db7599dafde7e75889e0f04280bf3afcc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,205,44,45,183,89,157,175,222,126,117,136,158,15,4,40,11,243,175,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
