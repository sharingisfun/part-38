This was released on CD in 2013.\n\nI ripped this using Rip Beta (Mac OSX). It is in ALAC format. I prefer ALAC to FLAC because of iTunes integration, but they are both lossless, so if you like FLAC it is very easy to convert, and you will lose no audio quality (XLD for Mac is free and does it quickly).\n\nLog and cue files are included.\n\nTracks:\n1. The Swan\n2. Sans\n3. Fountain Park\n4. Flake\n5. Coared\n6. Ripper\n7. Jacobi\n8. Froshed\n\n\nCheers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b0718bca36cb4e146af72f6a5d569250323d020","amp;dn":"Cheatahs+-+Extended+Plays+%5BALAC%5D+2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b0718bca36cb4e146af72f6a5d569250323d020","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,7,24,188,163,108,180,225,70,175,114,246,165,213,105,37,3,35,208,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
