It was encoded using LAME, one of the best MP3 encoders available (the quality of MP3 depends much of the encoder used).\n\nThe MP3&amp;#039;s are splitted in their respective tracks, not mixed like many shares. I think this is better, because it is much easier to record them in a CD. Also, it is better to select the tracks you really want to listen. If you prefer the one-MP3 format, you easily can mix the tracks using SoundForge or another sound editing program. To split the tracks of an already mixed album is very much dificult, and error-prone.\n\nIncludes playlists and the cd-cover. Total size: 190.13 MB. \n\n----------------------------------------------\n\n** WARNING ** \n\nThere is another torrent which claims to share Creamfields. However, it is just a joke, it is not Creamfields, not even Paul Oakenfold. It seems like video-game soundtrack.\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\nTrack listing\n\nDisc one\n\n   1. &quot;Point Zero&quot; by Li Kwan, presented by Matt Darey\n   2. &quot;I Found U&quot; by Interstate\n   3. &quot;First Sight&quot; by Duran and Aytek\n   4. &quot;Wadi&quot; by Sultan &amp; The Greek\n   5. &quot;Clear Blue&quot; by Elevation, presented by Markus Schulz\n   6. &quot;Como Tu (Paul Oakenfold Mix)&quot; by Carlos Vives\n   7. &quot;12&quot; by Tilt\n   8. &quot;Living the Dream&quot; by D:Fuse\n   9. &quot;Space Man?uveres Part 3&quot; by Quivver\n  10. &quot;The World Doesn&amp;#039;t Know&quot; by Tilt\n  11. &quot;Jump the Next Train (Probspot Mix)&quot; by Young Parisians featuring Ben Lost\n\nDisc two\n\n   1. &quot;Ocean of Love&quot; by DJ Suzy Solar\n   2. &quot;One Day&quot; by NuBreed and Luke Chable\n   3. &quot;Nice Guys Finish Last&quot; by Pinkbox Special\n   4. &quot;Cages (Lemon 8 Mix)&quot; by Girl Nobody\n   5. &quot;Scatterbomb (Original String Mix)&quot; by The Sneaker\n   6. &quot;Perfect Wave&quot; by Anthanasia, presented by Peter Martin\n   7. &quot;Time of Your Life (Shane 54 Mix)&quot; by Paul Oakenfold\n   8. &quot;People Want to be Needed&quot; by Auranaut\n   9. &quot;Particle&quot; by Stel &amp; Good Newz\n  10. &quot;Beautiful Day (Paul Oakenfold 2004 Mix)&quot; by U2\n  11. &quot;Lizard (Paul Oakenfold 2004 Remix)&quot; by Mauro Picotto\n  12. &quot;I&amp;#039;m Not Fooled (JOOF Tranced Out Mix)&quot; by John &quot;00&quot; Fleming\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\nThis is my first share.
