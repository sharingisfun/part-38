But when he sees something he was never meant to see on a covert mission gone bad, he finds himself-and his family-in the crosshairs. Nothing means more to Jim than protecting his loved ones, but when the enemy brings the battle to his front door, he is overwhelmed and taken down. That should be the end of the story. But Jim is raised from the dead by a sorcerer and recruited by a top secret unit dabbling in the occult, known only as the Gemini Cell. With powers he doesn't understand, Jim is called back to duty-as the ultimate warrior. As he wrestles with a literal inner demon, Jim realizes his new superiors are determined to use him for their own ends and keep him in the dark-especially about the fates of his wife and son","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cfa83a2391c2d0175b10747880f48faeed93fd7f","amp;dn":"Myke+Cole+-+Gemini+Cell+%28Shadow+Ops%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cfa83a2391c2d0175b10747880f48faeed93fd7f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,168,58,35,145,194,208,23,91,16,116,120,128,244,143,174,237,147,253,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
