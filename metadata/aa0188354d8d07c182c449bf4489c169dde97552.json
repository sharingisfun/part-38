He was born in Moscow and currently lives in The Netherlands. In Russia he has studied classical guitar where he graduated as a guitarist and a conductor for ensembles. Except for his solo performances he also works with various artists.\n\nThirty five years of playing the guitar gave Igor great experience: a fusion of different music genres from classical to world music with a jazz/pop flavor. Igor also plays the Russian 7-string guitar which was very popular in Russia in the 19th century. Only a few guitarists in the world play the 7-string guitar on a professional level. He has already made appearances on different TV and Radio shows.\n\nIn 2004 Igor was performing on the prestigious 34th International Fingerpicking Contest in Winfield (Kansas) USA. Igor is a performing artist who gives concerts on a national and international basis. Igor is an official Takamine artist, powered by Fender amplification.Ã¯Â»Â¿ \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa0188354d8d07c182c449bf4489c169dde97552","amp;dn":"Igor+Presnyakov+-+Acoustic+Rock+Ballad+Covers+-+Mp3+320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa0188354d8d07c182c449bf4489c169dde97552","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,1,136,53,77,141,7,193,130,196,73,191,68,137,193,105,221,233,117,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
