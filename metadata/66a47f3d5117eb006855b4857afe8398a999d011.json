Twenty preeminent scholars from diverse cultural backgrounds investigate how the vast sociopolitical changes of the postÃ¢â‚¬â€World War II era affected these women and how the ensuing events influenced the art that they produced. This book outlines the role these pivotal artists and their work played in reshaping the California cultural profile into what it is today.\n\nIllustrated with more than one hundred color plates and black-and-white reproductions, Art/Women/California 1950-2000 reveals the richness of this fifty-year period by contrasting and comparing the artists and their varied artistic practices in relation to the larger sociopolitical context. The book employs a variety of historical perspectives to reflect the distinct and parallel experiences of California's major cultural communities while revealing points of intersection by analyzing shared themes and practices.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:66a47f3d5117eb006855b4857afe8398a999d011","amp;dn":"Art+Women+California+1950-2000+-+Parallels+and+Intersections+%28Ar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"66a47f3d5117eb006855b4857afe8398a999d011","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,164,127,61,81,23,235,0,104,85,180,133,122,254,131,152,169,153,208,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
