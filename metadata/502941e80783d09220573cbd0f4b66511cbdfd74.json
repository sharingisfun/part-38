But it's not\nnice to buy when you do not know what you're buying.\nAs a matter of fact, DGN is a private group, and do not need rippers,\nfast or slow shells, traders, t1+ sites, couriers, prewhores, and hw\nsuppliers, we need only a nice chalet in Switzerland/Canada or a Villa\nin the Caribbean sea where to listen to some chillout music.\nIf you can supply any of those, for free, feel free to contact us for\nan application form.\n\nRemember to support the artists.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:502941e80783d09220573cbd0f4b66511cbdfd74","amp;dn":"Keith+Jarrett-Luminessence-2000-DGN-JKoop","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"502941e80783d09220573cbd0f4b66511cbdfd74","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,41,65,232,7,131,208,146,32,87,60,189,15,75,102,81,28,189,253,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
