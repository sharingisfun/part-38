They hail from Oakland, California. The band released two studio albums on London Records as Yesterday &amp; Today in the 1970s, before shortening their name to Y&amp;T and releasing several albums on A&amp;M Records beginning in 1981, as well as albums on Geffen Records, Avex Records, and others. The band was originally co-managed by Herbie Herbert (who also managed Journey) and Louis &quot;Lou&quot; Bramy. The band has sold over 4 million albums worldwide to date.\r\nY&amp;T's sixth studio album, In Rock We Trust, released in 1984, became the band's highest charting and selling album, reaching No. 46 on the Billboard 200. The album produced Y&amp;T's first big radio hit Don't Stop Runnin' ; the rights to She's A Liar were purchased by Dr Pepper and used in an ad campaign. To date, In Rock We Trust has sold over 450,000 copies, close to reaching gold certification status. This album was the only Y&amp;T album to chart in Canada, reaching No. 77 on the RPM chart.\r\n\r\nThe band's 1985 hit &quot;Summertime Girls&quot;, off their album Down for the Count, became the band's highest charting hit to date, reaching No. 55 on the Billboard Hot 100 and No. 17 on the U.S. mainstream rock charts. It received tremendous airplay worldwide, played frequently in the Baywatch television series, is graced in several feature films, received heavy rotation on MTV as well as MTVâ€™s top video playlists, and gets regular airplay today on classic rock radio stations throughout the United States.\r\n\r\nLeonard Haze was replaced by Jimmy DeGrasso in 1986 and Joey Alves was replaced by Stef Burns in 1989.
