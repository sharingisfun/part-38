Johnson\nAudiobook Narrated and Produced by Stephanie Murphy\n\n====================================================\n\n'Incredible Manifesto - Extremely Valuable' Sep 16 2012\nBy sebastian - Published on Amazon.com\n\n&quot;This text serves to dismantle the false dichotomy of State vs. the Capitalist. This fairytale has given way to joint-exploitation of the poor and oppressed by politicians and business elite.\n\nThe central thesis is that state coercion violently enforces capitalist privileges to the detriment of the masses. The state cannot be effectively used to ameliorate the injustices of corporate monopoly and rent-seeking because the state will always favor the politically-connected elite.\n\nIf more people read this book, the world would be a far better place. Highly recommended for political economists, left libertarians and market anarchists. \nFive stars.&quot;\n\n====================================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:60e3b81a55c6619346683729de19ef0ce53151b0","amp;dn":"Markets+Not+Capitalism+Audiobook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"60e3b81a55c6619346683729de19ef0ce53151b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,227,184,26,85,198,97,147,70,104,55,41,222,25,239,12,229,49,81,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
