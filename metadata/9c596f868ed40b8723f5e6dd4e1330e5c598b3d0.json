Otherwise, you will hear static.\n\nNotes and disclaimers:\nIt is not recommended that you downmix these tracks to stereo, transcode them in any way, or make any changes other to them than how they are presented here.\n\nIf you are not a fan of stereo-to-surround conversions, while I do recommend giving the SPEC mixes a chance, if it is not your intention to do so, please respect those who do get enjoyment out of these mixes and do not troll or flame on my, or anyone else's, posts.\n\nHow much do I love this comeback? Let me count the ways, and then pretend Audioslave and Timbaland colabs never happened. Great in 5.1. Your thoughts on where I kept the rears volume-wise may vary.\n\nTrack listing:\n\n01| Ã¢â‚¬Å“Been Away Too LongÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n02| Ã¢â‚¬Å“Non-State ActorÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n03| Ã¢â‚¬Å“By Crooked StepsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n04| Ã¢â‚¬Å“A Thousand Days BeforeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n05| Ã¢â‚¬Å“Blood on the Valley FloorÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n06| Ã¢â‚¬Å“Bones of BirdsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n07| Ã¢â‚¬Å“TareeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n08| Ã¢â‚¬Å“AttritionÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n09| Ã¢â‚¬Å“Black SaturdayÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n10| Ã¢â‚¬Å“Halfway ThereÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n11| Ã¢â‚¬Å“Worse DreamsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n12| Ã¢â‚¬Å“EyelidÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s MouthÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n13| Ã¢â‚¬Å“RowingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nEnjoy.\n\nDKA\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c596f868ed40b8723f5e6dd4e1330e5c598b3d0","amp;dn":"Soundgarden+-+King+Animal+%28SPEC+DTS+5.1+CD+by+DKA%29+%28SBU%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c596f868ed40b8723f5e6dd4e1330e5c598b3d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,89,111,134,142,212,11,135,35,245,230,221,78,19,48,229,197,152,179,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
