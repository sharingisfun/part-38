So it's only fair that Laswell should serve both as guest bassist and co-producer for Dieng's solo debut, and it's no surprise that they should enlist the help of various other Laswell buddies on the project -- bassist Bootsy Collins, guitarist Nicky Skopelitis, and keyboardist Bernie Worrell are all on board, and there's even a cameo by Last Poets alumnus Umar Bin Hassan.\n\n    Rhytmagick\n    Sabar\n    Takou\n    Daresalam\n    Boka Devotion\n    Soweto Funk\n    Touba\n    Dungal Dub","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c23f07c2ba59409ab19d62d9740de9798a0c22f0","amp;dn":"A%26iuml%3Byb+Dieng+-+Rhytmagick+%281995%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c23f07c2ba59409ab19d62d9740de9798a0c22f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,63,7,194,186,89,64,154,177,157,98,217,116,13,233,121,138,12,34,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
