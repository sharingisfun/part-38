For forty-five years, residents of this divided city lived radically different lives, both in terms of ideology and everyday experience. Silver questions the very notion of a shared language, focusing on changing definitions of words for political and economic systems - democracy, freedom, capitalism, socialism - as well as words used to describe nations and identity - nationality, Germany, history, foreigners, home.\n\nWatching the interviewees grapple with their own personal definitions of these ideologically loaded terms, viewers can't help but ask these same questions to themselves. In this way, Silver's project takes on a much larger scope, raising key question facing most countries today - what makes up a nation or a national identity; where do boundaries begin and end, who belongs within these boundaries and who does not..\n\nshot, directed, edited by\nShelly Silver\n\nassistant director/editor\nAnnette Maechtel\n\ninterviewers\nAnnette Maechtel, Anette Rose, Petra Stuben, Arnold Dreyblatt, Shelly Silver\n\ntranslation\nCornelia Walter, Anita Brown\n\non-line editors\nJeff Stabeneaux, Konrad Roman through the Standby Program\n\nfunded by\nDeutsche Akademischer Austauschdienst (DAAD) Berliner Kunstprogramm\nThe National Endowment for the Arts\nNew York Foundation for the Arts\nHartmut Horst","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4bdec03b6dc140df890f7d66c2f1a3d37b72216","amp;dn":"Former+East%2FFormer+West","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4bdec03b6dc140df890f7d66c2f1a3d37b72216","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,189,236,3,182,220,20,13,248,144,247,214,108,47,26,61,55,183,34,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
