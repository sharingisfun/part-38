Little Joshua Barker is in desperate need of a holiday miracle. No, he's not on his deathbed; no, his dog hasn't run away from home. But Josh is sure that he saw Santa take a shovel to the head, and now the seven-year-old has only one prayer: Please, Santa, come back from the dead.\n\nBut hold on! There's an angel waiting in the wings. (Wings, get it?) It's none other than the Archangel Raziel come to Earth seeking a small child with a wish that needs granting. Unfortunately, our angel's not sporting the brightest halo in the bunch, and before you can say &quot;Kris Kringle,&quot; he's botched his sacred mission and sent the residents of Pine Cove headlong into Christmas chaos, culminating in the most hilarious and horrifying holiday party the town has ever seen.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:554b1fd70c5cdd85e4c33aadf1c3488664c4d47b","amp;dn":"Christopher+Moore+-+The+Stupidest+Angel","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"554b1fd70c5cdd85e4c33aadf1c3488664c4d47b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,75,31,215,12,92,221,133,228,195,58,173,241,195,72,134,100,196,212,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
