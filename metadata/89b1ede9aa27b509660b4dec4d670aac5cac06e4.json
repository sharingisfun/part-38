Solo albums Seven Steps to Mercy (1997, produced by Michael Brook) and Invisible Fields (2005) brought widespread acclaim confirming OÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢LionÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡ird as one of contemporary musicÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most ambitious singers and recording artists.\nO'LionÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡ird has always been a collaborator and an artist seeking new fields of engagement. From his collaborations with Peter Gabriel on Ovo, this has taken an increasingly classical form. His song-cycle with Gavin Bryars, Anail De (The Breath of God) reflects a deep artistic collaboration and friendship with the composer. Similarly he has worked extensively with acclaimed Irish composer Donnacha Dennehy and his group The Crash Ensemble. On ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“FoxlightÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, his third solo album, Iarla has created a rich and mature work as producer Leo Abrahams returns OÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢LionÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡irdÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s remarkable voice to the heart of the music. \n\nIn an interview for Society of Sound Iarla talks about the making of this album: \n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLeo Abraham is the key song-writing collaborator. His guitar playing is lyrical and beautiful and restrained but at the same time quite adventurous ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ from a sonic point of view heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ahead of the curve. When youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re making a record such as this youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re concerned about songs ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the form and shape. But there are other things as well ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m often liable to start writing based on sound and texture ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ a voyage into sound as much as into songs. My work with Leo is another indicator of that ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the pure experience of listening to sound, arranging sounds to create sometimes-unexpected effects and to generate response and emotion. Some tracks on this record are much more about the sound field ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ particularly the song ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“StayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ a song about my father and me as a very young boy. Jon HopkinsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s contribution is the backbone, the skeleton ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s as much about the sequence of the sonic events as anything else.&quot;\n\n&quot;The lyrical content of the song is condensed ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s collapsed into one world almost ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the word ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“stayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢. Not a hell of a lot of word to be given the duty of carrying the whole message! But that then puts you into a position where youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re creating something that is so dependent upon every next droplet of music - the arrangement of microscopic tonal events that somehow reach your heart. I always look forward to mixing ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ we have been working in London and I couldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t wait to get into the studio at Real World. What we are trying to do is the iteration, the final burnishing. ThereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a sort of dark magic to mixing ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ foreground shifts and its all very subjective but at the same time you know when its right and if youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re lucky you know when thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s enough done.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nProducer and guitarist Leo Abrahams discusses the recording process: \n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI had an idea about how I wanted to frame IarlaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s voice; quite different to the way it had been done before. One of the things in art that I am really interested in is ambiguity and for me there was a lot of ambiguity in working with Iarla because I didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t understand what he was singing about! But nevertheless he is capable of communicating so much without using text that the majority of his listeners can understandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦but itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a thing that can be obscured by too much production or too many mysterious sounds. \n\nI have a small recording studio in East London with a little live room and a little control room. Although itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a digital studio it has lots of nice analogue warm-sounding equipment in it. But the room doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t have a huge amount of character ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ it doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t sound echoy like a church or exciting like a stone garageÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s quite dead. So that gave us a lot of control of what spaces we wanted to place the sounds in ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ we wanted the strings to sound like theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re in a church but weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d like the vocal to sound like its right next to your ear. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a very intimate sounding album that weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve come out with. Rather than have a lot of things covered in reverb, there are a lot things that are very dry and maybe one thing that sounds distant to give it more space. \n\nWhat I like in records is contrast. I like some sounds that are very ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“expensiveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ or ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“pureÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ sounding and other sounds that are tiny or sort of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“wrongÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢. So a lot of the piano is recorded with contact microphones that cost Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£ 5 each and then the vocal with an Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£ 8 000 microphone! Somehow that gives a distance between all the other elements that I think exaggerates their differences and makes everything sound deeper. \n\nOne of the thing IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve been exploring as a guitar player for a long time is creating ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“soundscapesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ basically ambient music using analogue sources. Even with analogue synthesisers youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re triggering something ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ pressing down a plastic key and triggering some kind of circuit event. If you are controlling very complicated sounds with a guitar string I find you can get a sort of expressiveness or a fault within that which balances our the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“coldnessÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ of the digital part. So most of the ambient sounds on the record have a very analogue and physical source - whether thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Jon HopkinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s contributions with piano or Leafcutter John using accordions or glockenspiels or me using guitars.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/about/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:89b1ede9aa27b509660b4dec4d670aac5cac06e4","amp;dn":"Iarla+%26Atilde%3B%E2%80%9C+Lion%26Atilde%3B%26iexcl%3Bird...Foxlight%282011%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"89b1ede9aa27b509660b4dec4d670aac5cac06e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,177,237,233,170,39,181,9,102,11,77,236,77,103,10,172,92,172,6,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
