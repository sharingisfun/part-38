Styling her sound Ã¢â‚¬Å“Modern Vintage,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Miss Tess strums and picks her way through an array of rhythms from ragtime to 30s swing to jump blues, her vocals soaring, powerful, but smooth as satin. She writes songs from her own life, infused with the flavors of early jazz, that conjure a cast of dreamers and lovers, down on their luck and charming their ways in and out of trouble. Familiar faces are known to mix in this crowd courtesy of folks like Bessie Smith and Tom Waits, perpetual muses to her style.\n\nHaving found her way to Boston and the storied Cambridge folk scene, Miss Tess put together The Bon Ton Parade, a dynamic, solo-swapping combo, comprised of drums, upright bass, lead guitar, sax and clarinet. This second album, &quot;Modern Vintage&quot;, features this band playing all original material.
