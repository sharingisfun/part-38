The interviews with band members and rock journalists in the 50-minute program touch on Maiden's early career, then delve into the creation of songs that have become hard-rock classics: the title song came about from a nightmare that bassist-songwriter Steve Harris couldn't shake, &quot;The Prisoner&quot; was inspired by the Patrick McGoohan television series, and the hit &quot;Run to the Hills&quot; made the sort of political statement (about white men's savage treatment of native peoples) that then-Capitol Records exec Don Zimmermann notes most American fans couldn't have cared less about while head-banging.\n\nTracklist:\n\n01.
