Several symposiums have been held in this regard, among which can be mentioned is that of the one held in Pollau, Austria in May 2012. There is need of a book that pays homage to these historical discoveries.\nThe aim of this book is to collect some typical papers written for researchers of the international cosmic ray community that many scientists and students would like to have in their libraries.\nThe main market for this book are universities and research institutes throughout the world, and mainly in countries where there is an old tradition in cosmic ray research: Europe, USA, MÃƒÂ©xico, Canada, East Europe (mainly Russia), Japan, Australia, China, etc. It should also be of interest in scientific societies, professional organizations, or other groups relevant to the several fields of particle physics: e.g. The Victor F. Hess Society and the European Physical Society/History of Physics Group (EPS/HoP), COSPAR, IUGG, American Geophysical Union, UniÃƒÂ³n GeofÃƒÂ­sica Mexicana, and others.\n(Imprint: Nova)\n\nProduct Details:\n\nSeries: Space Science, Exploration and Policies\nPDF: 509 pages\nPublisher: Nova Science Pub Inc (October 31, 2013)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1626189986\nISBN-13: 978-1626189980\n\n------------------------------------------------\nSeed - Share - Enjoy - Give me Thumbs Up\n------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d56d9d32fc7d0ec40a653e48b8bc4499fa873064","amp;dn":"Homage+to+the+Discovery+of+Cosmic+Rays%2C+the+Meson-muon+and+Solar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d56d9d32fc7d0ec40a653e48b8bc4499fa873064","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,109,157,50,252,125,14,196,10,101,62,72,184,188,68,153,250,135,48,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
