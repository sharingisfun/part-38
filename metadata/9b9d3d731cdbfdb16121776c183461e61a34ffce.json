Semiotext(e)&amp;#039;s three-decade history mirrors the history of American thought. Founded by French theorist and critic Sylvere Lotringer as a scholarly journal in 1974, Semiotext(e) quickly took on the mission of melding French theory with the American art world and punk underground. Its Foreign Agents, Native Agents, Active Agents and Double Agents imprints have brought together thinkers and writers as diverse as Gilles Deleuze, Assata Shakur, Bob Flanagan, Paul Virillio, Kate Millet, Jean Baudrillard, Michelle Tea, William S. Burroughs, Eileen Myles, Ulrike Meinhof, and Fanny Howe. In Hatred of Capitalism, editors Kraus and Lotringer bring these people together in the same volume for the first time.\n\nChris Kraus is a filmmaker and the author of I Love Dick and Aliens &amp; Anorexia, and coeditor of Hatred of Capitalism: A Semiotext(e) Reader. Index called her &quot;one of the most subversive voices in American fiction.&quot; Her work has been praised for its damning intelligence, vulnerability and dazzling speed.\n\nProfessor of French Literature and Philosophy at Columbia University and founder of Semiotext(e), SylvÃƒÂ¨re Lotringer is widely credited for having introduced poststructuralist theories in America. He has coedited Hatred of Capitalism (Semiotext(e), 2002), with Chris Kraus, and French Theory in America, with Sande Cohen. Semiotext(e) has published his book length dialogues with Paul Virilio, Pure War (1998), Crepuscular Dawn (2003), and The Accident of Art (2005).\n\nsource: dno, not my rip","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b9d3d731cdbfdb16121776c183461e61a34ffce","amp;dn":"Hatred+of+Capitalism%2C+A+Semiotext%28e%29+Reader+edited+by+Chris+Krau","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b9d3d731cdbfdb16121776c183461e61a34ffce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,157,61,115,28,219,253,177,97,33,119,108,24,52,97,230,26,52,255,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
