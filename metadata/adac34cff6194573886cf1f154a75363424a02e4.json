As Dr. Netter wrote in 1949 â€œclarification of a subject is the aim and goal of illustration. No matter how beautifully painted, how delicately and subtly rendered a subject may be, it is of little value as a medical illustration if it does not serve to make clear some medical point.â€ Dr. Netterâ€™s planning, conception, point of view, and approach are what inform his paintings and what make them so intellectually valuable.\r\nFrank H.
