Later That Same Year, the second album from Ian's new group Matthews Southern Comfort (it was released in late 1970, a mere six months after their debut, hence the title), is a beautiful set of songs that splits the difference between West Coast folk-rock and early country-rock, with Gordon Huntley's pedal steel and Roger Coulam's lending an air of sunny sadness that dovetails beautifully with Matthews' silky tenor.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6054007c5ec72d863aa28bd18d204173a23810bc","amp;dn":"Matthews%27+Southern+Comfort+-+Later+That+Same++%281970%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6054007c5ec72d863aa28bd18d204173a23810bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,84,0,124,94,199,45,134,58,162,139,209,141,32,65,115,162,56,16,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
