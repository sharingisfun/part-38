Implementing materials, performance, technology, and design and marketing, the book examines this rapidly emerging textile market and outlines future directions and growing trends. The book begins by explaining how a comfort-driven focus has led the industry to embrace knitted fabric as a popular choice of constructional material. Using examples of leading brands, it outlines the basic terminology, structural details, and essential properties appropriate for performance apparel, especially for sportswear. This book describes the differences between woven and knitted structures, provides an understanding of fabric behavior and the characteristics of a functional garment, and outlines the importance of garment fit and consumer perception of garment comfort in its design and development.\r\n\r\nThe authors present key research outcomes on the design and development of functional apparel designed for high-performance sportswear that explore smart materials, impact-resistant fabrics and pressure sensing. They consider the use of 3-D body scanning and its influence on pattern engineering for apparel product development; highlight the widely used fiber types for sportswear and the importance of fiber blends and their performance, and discuss the relevance of fabric structure and its interaction with the human body. The book also presents research on moisture management and temperature regulation and analyzes the performance and development of smart sportswear intended for monitoring health and performance for a range of end uses.\r\n\r\nA definitive guide detailing the future of functional clothing and sportswear, this book:\r\n\r\nDescribes how to design and develop functional clothing for sportswear\r\nReflects current research outcomes and industry requirements\r\nClarifies with visual illustration, practical examples, and case studies an understanding of techniques and concepts\r\nExplores specifics of garment design such as fit, shape, function, fashion and design\r\nFocuses on a commitment to designing ethical and sustainable products","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f810edf34cb4f00c5b3835b7d44e6e7dd8054632","amp;dn":"Materials+and+Technology+for+Sportswear+and+Performance+Apparel","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f810edf34cb4f00c5b3835b7d44e6e7dd8054632","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,16,237,243,76,180,240,12,91,56,53,183,212,78,110,125,216,5,70,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
