Offering a thorough and modern introduction to C++, this book is everything that an aspiring game programmer needs in order to learn the fundamentals of C++ and game programming basics. There is no programming experience necessary-the book starts at the beginning of C++ and game programming. Therefore, even readers without any previous programming experience can get as much out of the book as anyone else. Beginning C++ Game Programming presents a small but complete program for each new concept and a complete game program at the end of each chapter. It then presents readers with a final game project at the end of the book that combines most of the major topics covered. Skillfully written in an easy-to-understand manner, this book is a great place to get started with game programming.\n\n\nAbout the Author\nMichael Dawson, from Santa Monica, CA, is a professional writer and has worked as a programmer and game industry designer and producer.
