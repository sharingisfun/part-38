It's written like a reference book, read like a bible. Some parts of the book will be instructional, like a &quot;how-to&quot; guide. Ever wanted to know the steps to drop-kicking someone in the face? You bet your ass you have, and I will tell you how in my book. Other parts of the book will serve to document personal instances of manliness, giving you insight into the reason women from miles around migrate to my man cannon (hint: it's to get banged). I have manliness down to a science. Every letter of the alphabet stands for sheer masculinity. For example, &quot;A&quot; is for Ass Kicking, &quot;B&quot; is for Boners, &quot;C&quot; is for &quot;Copping a Feel,&quot; etc. From the manliest food to the manliest music, if it needs to be shaved, beaten, or sexed, there's a good chance it'll be in this book.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f57fbcb46910fab9b1fea04c53503f0a5250eb3e","amp;dn":"The+Alphabet+Of+Manliness.pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f57fbcb46910fab9b1fea04c53503f0a5250eb3e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,127,188,180,105,16,250,185,177,254,160,76,83,80,63,10,82,80,235,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
