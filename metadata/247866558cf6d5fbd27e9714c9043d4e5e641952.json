It was recorded just six months before Baker's death. His sad lyricism is a stirring presence throughout the half-dozen tunes. Haden's &quot;Silence&quot; is like a mournful prayer with Baker's trumpet at the fore. Elsewhere, Baker exhibits full commitment, even on pieces that had been in his repertoire for 35 years at that point (&quot;My Funny Valentine&quot; and &quot;Round About Midnight&quot;). Italian pianist Pieranunzi plays in a style that embraces jazz, but draws from classical music (not unlike Bill Evans). Higgins has worked with Haden off and on since their time together with Ornette Coleman in the '50s. He brings a modernist's sensibility to his playing, along with a light and elegant touch that perfectly suits the quiet nature of this set. All in all, this is a masterful union, one that's perfectly and cleanly documented.
