Upon getting out, \nLion-O uses the Sword of Omens to seal the cave in order to keep them out. \nJust then, a Stone Giant awakens and finds some dead Wraiths. Later that night, \nLion-O returns and learns from Ahnet that the &quot;universe is out of tune&quot; and that \ntheir sounds is what kept the Stone Giant awake. While the Elephants meditate, \nthe ThunderCats do battle with the Stone Giant where they discover that every \nattack they do on it, the Stone Giant reassembles.
