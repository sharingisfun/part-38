He was awarded the Bremen Literature Prize in 1958 and the Georg BÃƒÂ¼chner Prize in 1960. Celan committed suicide by drowning in the Seine river in Paris in 1970.\n\nTranslated from the German by Michael Hamburger and Christopher Middleton, with an Introduction by Michael Hamburger, these selected poems are drawn from Mohn und GedÃƒÂ¤chtnis (1952); Von Schwelle zu Schwelle (1955); Sprachgitter (1959); Die Niemandsrose (1963); Atemwende (1967); Fadensonnen (1968); Lichtzwang (1970); and Schneepart (1971).\n\nCelan's most famous poem, the early &quot;Todesfuge&quot; (&quot;Fugue of Death&quot;), commemorating the Nazi death camps, is a work of great complexity and extraordinary power, and is included here. In later years his poetry became progressively more cryptic, fractured and monosyllabic, bearing comparison to the music of Anton Webern.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f8512bd9b6c69ed05c8752d31444eaacdfd8c5dd","amp;dn":"Paul+Celan+-+Selected+Poems+%281972%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f8512bd9b6c69ed05c8752d31444eaacdfd8c5dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,81,43,217,182,198,158,208,92,135,82,211,20,68,234,172,223,216,197,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
