Melancholic, uplifting, energetic, calm... It's all there! \n\nSpecial thanks to RI for doing the amazing Coverart, to General Mumble for doing the typography and to Lavender Harmony for doing the video editing. I'd also like to thank Icky, Artattack, Whitetail, Michael A, Jamison, Dashi, Lavender Harmony (again) and Command Spry for giving lots of feedback and for putting up with my constant spamming of WIPs.&quot; ~Addictia","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da5c93d86be869dd2111fb864098940d593075ba","amp;dn":"Addictia+-+Diversity+EP+MP3+320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da5c93d86be869dd2111fb864098940d593075ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,92,147,216,107,232,105,221,33,17,251,134,64,152,148,13,89,48,117,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
