One day, afraid he might miss the utility person, he opens the door to find a cute, mysterious girl, accompanying an elderly religious solicitor.\n\nThrough what seems to be a chain of coincidences, the girl, Nakahara Misaki, enters Tatsuhiro's life, and promises him that she will cure him of his anti-social condition, provided that he follows the rules that she sets out for him.\n\nThis takes Tatsuhiro from a desperate attempt at creating a galge computer game, to unwittingly joining a suicide cult, to participating in a pyramid scheme, to immersing himself in a MMORPG, along the way touching upon everything between hikikomori and otaku culture, existentialism, solipsism, theology, suicide, sacrifice and love.
