Unlike Noble Causes, Faerber created Dynamo 5 with the intent of making it more action-driven. The team is composed of five young men and women, each of whom inherited one of the five superhuman abilities of their father, the late superhero Captain Dynamo, and their mentor and leader, DynamoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s widow, Madeline &quot;Maddie&quot; Warner, who assembled the team following DynamoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s death.\nThe focus of the series alternates back and forth between the private lives of each of the five team members, who maintain their separate lives in their home cities across North America, including their respective supporting casts, and their adventures as costumed superheroes\n\nCreated by writer Jay Faerber and artist Mahmud A. Asra. Faerber explained that his inspiration for the series came from a conversation he had with editor Andy Helfer, in which he was asked what made the Teen Titans unique. When Faerber opined that the Titans were like a family, Helfer pointed out that all superhero teams could be described thus as well. From this Faerber decided to create a team that was a family in the literal biological sense, but did not act like it. Faerber also indicated, perhaps half-jokingly, that he was also influenced by unresolved issues stemming from his parentsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ divorce.\n\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e059df724af83a3c9a5306df5aaab8162274a7c4","amp;dn":"Dynamo+5+%281-18+Annual%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e059df724af83a3c9a5306df5aaab8162274a7c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,89,223,114,74,248,58,60,154,83,6,223,90,170,184,22,34,116,167,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
