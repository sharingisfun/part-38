Woollett, Ariane van Suchtelen, &quot;Rubens and Brueghel: A Working Friendship&quot;\nGetty | 2006 | ISBN: 0892368489 | English | PDF | 270 pages | 27.5 Mb\n\nAt the beginning of the seventeenth century, Peter Paul Rubens and Jan Brueghel the Elder were the two most famous painters in Antwerp. They were also close friends and frequent collaborators, who over the course of twenty-five years, from about 1598 to 1625, executed approximately two dozen works together. The two artists had much in commonÃ¢â‚¬â€they both oversaw productive workshops and had the honor and distinction of serving as court painters to the regents of the Southern NetherlandsÃ¢â‚¬â€but their joint oeuvre benefited greatly from their differences. A prolific landscape and still-life painter, Brueghel was renowned for his remarkably meticulous and jewel-like works, which won him the sobriquet Ã¢â‚¬Å“the Velvet Brueghel.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Rubens was an ambitious painter of large-scale altarpieces and history paintings, who was notably successful at capturing emotion and corporeal energy. The uniting of their distinctive styles of brushwork and individual visual modes produced beautiful and richly allusive compositions that are as highly sought after today as they were by the artistsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ contemporaries.\n\nRubens and Brueghel: A Working Friendship is the first international loan exhibition devoted to the artistsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ collaborative works and an investigation of their working methods. Assembled here are some of the most important works of Brueghel and RubensÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s partnershipÃ¢â‚¬â€from the early war themes, to mythological landscapes and allegories, to iconic paintings of the Madonna and Child surrounded by garlands of fruit and flowersÃ¢â‚¬â€as well as a select group of works executed with other collaborators, including Hans Rottenhammer, Hendrick de Clerck, Hendrick van Balen, and Frans Snyders. Together, these paintings reveal the nature of collaboration as practiced in the Netherlands in this period. What also emerges is the unique character of Brueghel and RubensÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s conceptual allianceÃ¢â‚¬â€a rare partnership of equals, a complex and reciprocal relationship that gave rise to works of unparalleled delight.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2edd7d1c783c244c431f40bda955b51c7a928fca","amp;dn":"Rubens+and+Brueghel+-+A+Working+Friendship+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2edd7d1c783c244c431f40bda955b51c7a928fca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,221,125,28,120,60,36,76,67,31,64,189,169,85,181,28,122,146,143,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
