Acknowledging that plant nutrition in greenhouse cultivation differs in many essentials from field production, this volume details specific information about testing methods for soils and substrates in a greenhouse environment. It does so while offering a universally applicable analysis. This is based on the composition of the soil and substrate solutions, methods for the interpretation of tissue tests, and crop responses on salinity and water supply in relation to fertilizer application. Fertilizer additions, related to analytical data of soil and substrate samples, are presented for a wide range of vegetable and ornamental crops. The subject is especially apt now as substrate growing offers excellent possibilities for the optimal use of water and nutrients, as well as the potential for sustainable production methods for greenhouse crops.\nProduct Details\n\n    * Hardcover: 431 pages\n    * Publisher: Springer; 1 edition (October 2, 2009)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 9048125316\n    * ISBN-13: 978-9048125319","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:733949bfcd83f5ccc4ea00a0f8db825264cb16a9","amp;dn":"Plant+Nutrition+of+Greenhouse+Crops%2C+1st+Edition%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"733949bfcd83f5ccc4ea00a0f8db825264cb16a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,57,73,191,205,131,245,204,196,234,0,160,248,219,130,82,100,203,22,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
