On the way, he joins an Aussie rancher in the parched outback and takes part in a spectacular camel round-up. This mad adventure, involving specially adapted off-road vehicles and a chopper, is part of an ongoing effort to stop the damaging spread of up to a million feral camels across the country. Finally in Perth, Simon discovers a full scale British invasion. Working in a mine or driving a lorry can bring a salary of a hundred thousand pounds a year, as evidenced when Simon meets a former bin man from hull who is now living the dream, with a beautiful house in the sun, private pool and his very own boat.\n\n\n2) Part 2\nSimon travels from Darwin in Australia's Northern Territory or 'Top End', across to the remote Cape York Peninsula, and on to the Great Barrier Reef. Simon sets off from Kakadu, the largest national park in the world, where the wildlife is under threat from the march of millions of poisonous cane toads. He joins a team of toad-busters catching the amphibian invaders - originally introduced to the country to kill pests. In Robertson barracks Simon meets Australia's best - and only - tank regiment. They will soon host 6,000 American Marines - evidence of Australia's strategic importance in the Asia Pacific region. On the Cape York Peninsula Simon joins scientists catching deadly box jellyfish, whose venom could prove to have great medicinal value. And on the Great Barrier Reef he dives in search of the starfish destroying coral, before flying 100 miles out into the ocean to watch as a huge tanker is expertly guided through the fragile reef.\n\n\n3) Part 3\nSimon travels travels down the east coast to the magnificent cities of Sydney and Melbourne in the final part of his journey. Simon's journey starts in Surfers Paradise near the city of Gold Coast, the Las Vegas of Australia. Behind the sun and surf, this area has become the organised crime capital of Australia. Police are cracking down on outlaw motorcycle clubs, accused of being criminal gangs. Simon meets the most notorious and feared biker group in Australia to hear their side of the story. Arriving in Sydney, Simon discovers a city of huge cultural diversity closely linked to its booming Asian neighbours, India and China. One in ten Aussies are now of Asian origin. Simon gauges Australia's attitude to immigration and meets the country's first Muslim ladies Aussie Rules Football team. On the very last stretch of the journey, Simon takes to the air to witness the devastating and deadly bush fires ripping through the country, before reaching his final destination, Melbourne, just in time to celebrate Australia Day.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img844.imageshack.us/img844/8421/australiabbcscreen0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img844.imageshack.us/img844/8421/australiabbcscreen0.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img442.imageshack.us/img442/2630/australiabbcscreen1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img442.imageshack.us/img442/2630/australiabbcscreen1.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img689.imageshack.us/img689/5295/australiabbcscreen2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img689.imageshack.us/img689/5295/australiabbcscreen2.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img856.imageshack.us/img856/7146/australiabbcscreen3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img856.imageshack.us/img856/7146/australiabbcscreen3.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img402.imageshack.us/img402/1020/australiabbcscreen4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img402.imageshack.us/img402/1020/australiabbcscreen4.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img593.imageshack.us/img593/5204/australiabbcscreen5.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img593.imageshack.us/img593/5204/australiabbcscreen5.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img41.imageshack.us/img41/6752/australiabbcscreen6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img41.imageshack.us/img41/6752/australiabbcscreen6.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img855.imageshack.us/img855/1596/australiabbcscreen7.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img855.imageshack.us/img855/1596/australiabbcscreen7.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img401.imageshack.us/img401/8319/australiabbcscreen8.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img401.imageshack.us/img401/8319/australiabbcscreen8.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4/&gt;\n * Video Bitrate: 1500 kbps/&gt;\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 404/&gt;\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.775 (~16:9)/&gt;\n * Frames Per Second: 25/&gt;\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)/&gt;\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 kb/s CBR 48000 Hz)/&gt;\n * Audio Streams: 2/&gt;\n * Audio Languages: English/&gt;\n * RunTime Per Part: 59.Mins/&gt;\n * Number Of Parts: 3/&gt;\n * Part Size: average 691 MB/&gt;\n * Source: PDTV/&gt;\n * Encoded by Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01xzcwd&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01xzcwd&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:187b5cc28e37ee5ca732a0f5d6b9da48d40fc517","amp;dn":"BBC+Australia+with+Simon+Reeve+2of3+PDTV+XviD+AC3+MVGroup.org","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"187b5cc28e37ee5ca732a0f5d6b9da48d40fc517","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,123,92,194,142,55,238,92,167,50,160,245,214,185,218,72,212,15,197,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
