Despite the apparent freedom, it\nall sounds very focused and coherent and it was possibly discussed before\nplaying, or maybe not, and these four stellar musicians are just so good and so\nused to playing together, that this symbiosis of fragile and raw sounds might\nhave been created spontaneously&quot;.\n\nI am not quite sure how to say it differently for this album : the music is\nmoving without being sentimental. It has nothing of traditional music, yet it\nis drenched in familiar sounds that are organised differently, not around\nstructure but around each other, growing organically, with subtle pulse. It can\nbe sweet and bluesy (&quot;My Kind Of Poetry&quot;, &quot;Old School&quot;), it can also be\nadventurous and full of expressive outbursts (&quot;Zero Gravity&quot;, &quot;Expert Set&quot;)\n... and excellent throughout.\n\n--\n\nby Jose Carlos Fernandes (pt)\n\nby Luc Bouquet (fr) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://grisli.canalblog.com/tag/Peter%20Bitenc&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://grisli.canalblog.com/tag/Peter%20Bitenc&lt;/a&gt;\n\nby Pachi Tapiz (es) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bun.tomajazz.com/2011/02/daniel-levin-quartet-organic-modernism.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bun.tomajazz.com/2011/02/daniel-levin-quartet-organic-modernism.html&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:90240c4e3450b356e28276b83eb0aea5457ee415","amp;dn":"Daniel+Levin+Quartet+-+Organic+Modernism+%282011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"90240c4e3450b356e28276b83eb0aea5457ee415","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,36,12,78,52,80,179,86,226,130,118,184,62,176,174,165,69,126,228,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
