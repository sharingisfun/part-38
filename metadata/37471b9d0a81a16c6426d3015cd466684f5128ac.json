S. Venttsel.\n\n\n      This book treats in a popular manner the elements of game theory and some methods for solving matrix games. It contains almost no proofs and illustrates the basic principles with examples. To be able to read the book, an acquaintance with the elements of probability theory and calculus is enough. The book is intended to disseminate the ideas of game theory which have practical economic or military applications.\n\nThe book was translated the Russian by Vladimir Shokurov and was  first published by Mir in 1980.\n\n  PDF | Cover | Bookmarks | OCR | 3.8 MB | 76 pp | 600 dpi\nReleased on TPB by mirtitles.org\n links here.\n\nContents\n1.
