After her trial she is not executed or taken to prison, but to a school for special operatives. She is told that Nikita no longer exists and she will be trained to pay back society for what she has done, as a spy/assassin. She is trained for over two years and with no warning is handed a gun in a restaurant and told to kill the man at the next table as her handler leaves.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f264d54dd2dad63dd239cb088ca81794321311ec","amp;dn":"Nikita+%281990%29+French+Language%2C+English+Subs+%28640x256%29.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f264d54dd2dad63dd239cb088ca81794321311ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,100,213,77,210,218,214,61,210,57,203,8,140,168,23,148,50,19,17,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
