However, these have been ripped to multiple formats and standards. What I noticed is that there was both a shortage of the older films, and that many had not been ripped to the most basic and widely used format; Xvid AVI files. Many also had various other deficiencies, such as missing extras, no subtitles, low resolution, poor seeding, or comments from downloaders noting various technical problems.\n\nSo, I have endeavored to create new and clean, fresh rips, including all the extras and so forth. I am seeding each film (starting with the first BP winner, 1928s WINGS) individually, complete with full documentation and screenshots, and clearer labeling. A couple of the oldest films were swiped from existing torrents because a good commercial copy of the DVD is unavailable, but the rest are fresh rips IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve made using DVDFab. My technical standards was to try to keep each film to at least .15 pixels. Each film has two passes.\n\n\n1936 - THE GREAT ZIEGFELD (William Powell, Myrna Loy)\n\n1937 - THE LIFE OF EMILE ZOLA (Paul Muni)\n\n1938 - YOU CAN'T TAKE IT WITH YOU (Frank Capra, Lionel Barrymore, Jimmy Stewart)\n\n1939 - GONE WITH THE WIND (Vivien Leigh, Clark Gable)\n\n1940 - REBECCA (Alfred Hitchcock, Laurence Olivier, Joan Fontaine)\n\n\n\nNOTE - To save space, the extras from GONE WITH THE WIND have been omitted.
