And that was just on their debut. Throughout their first three albums, VU continued to challenge societal norms through their lyrics and rock music itself through their unorthodox instrumental approach. Their sound was theirs alone, which proved to be an obstacle when it came to sales. The majority of popular music fans simply werenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t ready for the bleakly beautiful vision of VU. But for those who were, this LP trilogy was a clarion call, drawing together the outsiders who felt disenfranchised and unfulfilled by Top Forty fodder. Like time release capsules, these LPs became catalysts for change as they spread from city to city and were consumed by adventurous listeners. Bands formed, scenes coalesced and new musical paths emerged which would eventually branch off into punk, alternative, indie and more. Take a sample from any underground music genre and youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re likely to find VU DNA pulsing through its core.\n\nAs the alternative scene grew, so did the legend of the Velvet Underground. However, with relatively few of the original LPs in circulation, finding them could be difficult and, as a result, more people had probably heard OF the band than had actually heard their music. The emergence of compact discs in the mid-80s, along with a groundswell of VU-influenced bands singing their praises, finally got their music into wider distribution. Yet, for vinyl enthusiasts who longed to place those precious albums on their turntables, that thrill remained elusive.\n\nUntil now. With tremendous pride, Sundazed presents The Velvet Underground: The MGM/Verve Albums. This beautiful, deluxe boxed set gathers the rare mono versions of the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first three studio albums along with the superior mono version of NicoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Chelsea Girl and a definitive edition of the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unfinished fourth album!
