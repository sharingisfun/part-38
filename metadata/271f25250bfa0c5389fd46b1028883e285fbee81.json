Yehudi Menuhin has created this expansive survey of musical traditions from five continents. With panoramic vision and infectious enthusiasm, he takes us from primeval rhythms of Africa to the symphonies of Beethoven, from plainsong to jazz, from Swiss yodeling to Irish jig, from steel drum to electronic synthesizer.\nThe Music of Man was a series of eight hour-long specials with host Yehudi Menuhin, following the development of music from its beginnings at the dawn of history to the electronic experiments, jazz and rock of our own time. Menuhin, the renowned violinist, conductor and humanist, participated both as violin soloist and conductor throughout the series, and was also co-writer. Filmed in locations around the world, The Music of Man was produced in English and in French. Composers ranged from improvising African tribesmen, Canadian Indians and Southern revivalists to Perotinus, Machaut, Gabrieli, Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Wagner, Debussy and Bartok. Many famous artists from around the world participated, among them sitarist Ravi Shankar, violinist Jean Carignan, jazz pianist Oscar Peterson, contralto Maureen Forrester, composers Aaron Copland and Murray Schafer, and pianist and musicologist Glenn Gould. The films took five years to make, required two separate camera teams which travelled to 500 locations, and amassed more than 165 km of film.\n\nWriters: Yehudi Menuhin, Curtis W. Davis, and Charles Weir.\nProducers: Curtis W. Davis, Richard Bocking and John Thomson\nCo-produced by CBC, the Ontario Educational Communications Authority, and the Mississippi Authority for Educational Television.\n\n3)  New Voices for Man \nAt the height of the Renaissance in Italy Monteverdi wrote the first opera, a form of entertainment instantly popular throughout Europe. Corelli created the sonata form and new instruments were developed. The development of musical instruments began to challenge the dominance of the human voice, and violin-making readied its finest form in Italy with Stradivari and Guarneri. Lully was the musical giant at the Court of Versailles. In England, Purcell was perhaps the first great modern composer and Handel brought works for voice of lasting inspiration. Performing are Accademia Monteverdiana conducted by Denis Stevens, Toronto Symphony Orchestra, George Malcolm, Robert Donington, Camerata Lysy, David Rubio, Maureen Forrester, Brighton Harnoncourt with Cathy Berberian and Franz Mazura, Victor Monge &quot;Serranito,&quot; Bana and Chigaba Chisiko, Kelly Academy of Irish Dancing, members of the Munchner Symphoniker.
