It would have been places after Don&amp;#039;t Leave Me Now, but the ending of the song doesn&amp;#039;t really accommodate anything other than Young Lust.\n-Young Lust has a portion of the cut introduction replaced. (The sound quality&amp;#039;s a bit off, but it works pretty well.)\n-What Shall We Do Now? has been moved in between Don&amp;#039;t Leave Me Now and Another Brick pt3, the way it was on the &amp;#039;Under Construction&amp;#039; demo.\n-The version of Hey You cut from the film has been included.\n-Some of the sound effects in Is There Anybody Out There? have been reduced in volume.\n-Bring The Boys Back Home is the extended film version, from the b-side of the When The Tigers Broke Free single.\n-The Show Must Go On is restored, using the CD version.\n-Some of the edits in Run Like Hell and Waiting For The Worms have been re-created using the CD version, so there&amp;#039;s much less interference from the film sound effects.\n-The &amp;#039;Isn&amp;#039;t this where ... we came in&amp;#039; loop has been recreated using the quote from the DVD commentary. Works quite well!\n-Also included: a disc&amp;#039;s worth of bonus tracks, consisting of some single and promo mixes, and some interesting bits isolated from the DVD&amp;#039;s 5.1 mix.\n\nIf you&amp;#039;re interested in a more detailed list of the changes and sources, a cue / edit list for discs one and two are included.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a00658bd5c7e3f7587fcea6c7f3c61772966dd4","amp;dn":"Pink+Floyd+-+The+Wall+Film+Soundtrack+%5C%22Fan+Edit%5C%22+3+CDs+%28bo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a00658bd5c7e3f7587fcea6c7f3c61772966dd4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,0,101,139,213,199,227,247,88,127,206,166,199,243,198,23,114,150,109,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
