The earth and the sea. The conscious and the unconscious.\nOne finds things on the beach. Things dragged up from the depths, and casualiy abandoned by the sea, almost as a peace offering to its eternal opposite, the land. But not ali things found on beaches are material. Some are insubstantial: stories, dreams, ideas. Moebius has called these ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œdream artifactsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½.\nThe stories coliected in this book ane just that: dream artifacts. Strange stories.\nThe Webster New Collegiate Dictionary defines the adjective strange as a: not before known, heard or seen, and b: exciting wonder, aweÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. This seems a particularly appropniate description for these stories, when one considers the creative process which led to their making.\nIt all began with the first image. There was no script, no notes, no preconceived ideas of a direction, only the pure joy of the artist, who drew as inspiration came to him. And during the haif hour or so it took him to draw the first image, his mind wandered. While his hand follawed the careful automatisms it had practiced for a lifetime, his spirit took a figurative walk on the beach. And there, it began to imagine what the second image would be like.\nExcitement grew Inspiration flew The artist began working on the second image. And, like Scheherazade spinning her yarns over a thousand and one nights, each image thus led to the next one, and the next, until, at last, he had reached the end of the story.\nThe story thus becomes almost its own creator, and the artist only a medium. Strangely enough, one can find an interesting parallel in modern physics, where it is said that the presence of the observer now affects the nature of the experiment.\nBut we would rather think of this book as a promenade on the beach of the MoebiusÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ universe.&quot;\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDont forget to block the p2p terrorists in your client: Ip range 209.249.0.0 - 209.249.255.255 is bad!\n\nAnd please report any other abusive IP's you notice while glancing at your log screen.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEnjoy\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e3e406864b549637b0a1cd8cee26476c89cf979","amp;dn":"Moebius+6+%28Epic%29+-+Pharagonesia+%26+other+strange+stories+%5BCBR%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e3e406864b549637b0a1cd8cee26476c89cf979","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,62,64,104,100,181,73,99,123,10,28,216,206,226,100,118,200,156,249,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
