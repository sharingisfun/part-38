A no-man s land of our own making was created and left to its own devices.\nIn the interim, something remarkable has happened. Forests, marshes, fields, and rivers have reclaimed the land, reversing the effects of human cultivation and development, returning everything to its natural state.\nIn the absence of people, the dead zone has become a surprising post-nuclear Eden, populated by beaver and bison, horses and birds, fish and falcons and ruled by wolves.\nNow that access to the zone is permitted, at least on a limited basis, scientists are trying to learn how the surviving wildlife is coping with the invisible blight of the land.\nAs the top predators in this new wilderness, wolves reflect the condition of the entire eco-system. If the wolves are doing well, the populations of their prey must also be doing well.\nAccordingly, a key long-term study of the wolves has been initiated to determine their health, their range, and their numbers.\nIt's an amazing exploration into a world we hoped never to see which yields answers we never expected.\n\nCast:\nHarry Smith ...Narrator\n\nVideo Specs:\nContainer and Codec: MP4 | H.264/MPEG-4 AVC\nFrontend And Writing Library: Ripbot264 | x264 core 129 r2245 bc13772\nBitrate: 10.5 Mbps\nMaximum Bitrate: 62.5 Mbps\nEncoding: 2 Pass | &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;c68eafa1ae868af2e8f7&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nResolution: 1920 x 1080\nDisplay Aspect Ratio: 16:9\nQuality Factor (QF): 0.211\nFrame Rate: 23.976 Fps\n\nAudio Specs:\nAudio Codec And Type: Advanced Audio Codec (AAC) | MPEG-4 (mp4a)\nWriting Application: Ripbot264 AAC codec\nFormat profile: LC\nBitrate Mode: Variable\nBitrate: 320 Kbps\nMaximum Bitrate: 331 Kbps\nSample Rate: 48.0 KHz\nChannel Count: 6 Ch - Front: L C R, Rear: L R, LFE\n\nCompatable with PS3, Most Set Top Media Players and Most Media Ready HDTV's.\n\nIMDB: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2054304/\nIMDb Rating: 7.9/10 (29 Users)\nTrailer:\nInfo Hash: E8BEF5964373AC8DD4CA1E3C1F78D565C92BB3FC\n\nWe Are Looking For Early Access To Anything You Can Provide CAMS, TS, DVD Screeners, VHS Screeners, DVDRips, Direct Audio, Early Music Release - Contact Us @ &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;6f1c001a1d0c0a1c2f040601080b00024204190c0b41010a1b&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nRespect:KingBen, BLaZE, KK, Paulx1, Jo, SecretMyth, room101bellboy\nGreets: AcBC, HoncHo, RyD3R, SkETER, TwIzZy, GreatMagician, SkNH3D23 - All Of Kingdom, UKB &amp; Release-Lounge, HDChina, CHD, IPT, ExtraTorrent, H33T, FLAWL3SS, 1337x, And Many More.\n\n\nScreens:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.com/a/img23/1905/oc03.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.com/a/img23/1905/oc03.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.com/a/img842/8386/o9nf.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.com/a/img842/8386/o9nf.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.com/a/img607/4307/b81g.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.com/a/img607/4307/b81g.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.com/a/img542/249/j1vg.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.com/a/img542/249/j1vg.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nNote: A video sample is included in the folder for those who want to check quality and compatibility before downloading the whole movie.\nAnd don't fall for fakes, grab our encodes from the source or from our trusted accounts elsewhere.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8bef5964373ac8dd4ca1e3c1f78d565c92bb3fc","amp;dn":"PBS+Nature%3A+Radioactive+Wolves+2011+1080p+BDRip+H264+AAC+-+KiNGD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8bef5964373ac8dd4ca1e3c1f78d565c92bb3fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,190,245,150,67,115,172,141,212,202,30,60,31,120,213,101,201,43,179,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
