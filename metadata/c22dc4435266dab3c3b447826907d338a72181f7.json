Now Sarah Dunant turns her discerning eye to one of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most intriguing and infamous families Ã¢â‚¬â€ the Borgias Ã¢â‚¬â€ in an engrossing work of literary fiction.\n\nBy the end of the fifteenth century, the beauty and creativity of Italy is matched by its brutality and corruption, nowhere more than in Rome and inside the Church. When Cardinal Rodrigo Borgia buys his way into the papacy as Alexander VI, he is defined not just by his wealth or his passionate love for his illegitimate children, but by his blood: He is a Spanish Pope in a city run by Italians. If the Borgias are to triumph, this charismatic, consummate politician with a huge appetite for life, women, and power must use papacy and familyÃ¢â‚¬â€in particular, his eldest son, Cesare, and his daughter LucreziaÃ¢â‚¬â€in order to succeed.\n\nCesare, with a dazzlingly cold intelligence and an even colder soul, is his greatestÃ¢â‚¬â€though increasingly unstableÃ¢â‚¬â€weapon. Later immortalized in MachiavelliÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s The Prince, he provides the energy and the muscle. Lucrezia, beloved by both men, is the prime dynastic tool. Twelve years old when the novel opens, hers is a journey through three marriages, and from childish innocence to painful experience, from pawn to political player.\n\nStripping away the myths around the Borgias, Blood &amp; Beauty is a majestic novel that breathes life into this astonishing family and celebrates the raw power of history itself: compelling, complex and relentless.\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c22dc4435266dab3c3b447826907d338a72181f7","amp;dn":"The+Borgias+-+Sarah+Dunant++%282013++-++Retail+epub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c22dc4435266dab3c3b447826907d338a72181f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,45,196,67,82,102,218,179,195,180,71,130,105,7,211,56,167,33,129,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
