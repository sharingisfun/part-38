Caught up in stormy weather, he makes it to safety in the nick of time, to tell the story of Sir Francis Drake and a fantastic array of adventurers, explorers, pirates and smugglers. It's also a chance for David to enjoy some of Britain's most beautiful coastline and turn his hand to a bit of art himself. David also gingerly submits himself to one of the oldest maritime art forms of all - the art of the tattoo!\n\n2)  Invasion and Defence \nDavid Dimbleby continues his voyage round Britain, sailing his boat Rocket along the south east coast from Hampshire to Kent. This was the front line coast, the edge of Britain essential to its defence and the first point of attack for invasion forces. From the great battleships of Nelson to the sea forts of Henry VIII, this is a story that embraces Britain's darkest and most heroic moments.\n\n3)  Pleasure and Escape \nThis third episode traces the crucial importance of the sea to Britain's trade and to individual livelihoods of coastal communities. Joined on this leg of his epic sail by his son Fred, David follows the trade routes of the west coast of Scotland along the monumental channels that cut through the Romantic Highlands and brought wealth and prosperity to the heart of Scotland. The journey starts at Craobh Haven and takes David along the Crinan Canal, around the Isle of Bute and up the River Clyde towards Glasgow.\n\n4)  Trade and Romance \nHaving examined the sea as a source of exploration, defence and trade, David Dimbleby explores how it emerged as a source of pleasure, Punch and Judy and sand sculpture. Starting at Gorleston-on-Sea, David explores the creation of a seaside holiday culture that remains uniquely British to this day. Sailing down the Suffolk and Essex coasts and into the Thames, David also shows how the sea became an irresistible subject for our most celebrated artists and architects, before finally docking in the very heart of British maritime power: Greenwich.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img440.imageshack.us/img440/3397/6l57.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img440.imageshack.us/img440/3397/6l57.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img826.imageshack.us/img826/3823/fezl.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img826.imageshack.us/img826/3823/fezl.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img607.imageshack.us/img607/6057/ufyf.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img607.imageshack.us/img607/6057/ufyf.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img854.imageshack.us/img854/989/6ug1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img854.imageshack.us/img854/989/6ug1.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img42.imageshack.us/img42/3624/w3an.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img42.imageshack.us/img42/3624/w3an.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img17.imageshack.us/img17/4199/f49b.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img17.imageshack.us/img17/4199/f49b.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img199.imageshack.us/img199/3189/pnfr.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img199.imageshack.us/img199/3189/pnfr.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img268.imageshack.us/img268/1359/rrds.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img268.imageshack.us/img268/1359/rrds.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img834.imageshack.us/img834/7796/cb7s.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img834.imageshack.us/img834/7796/cb7s.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img594.imageshack.us/img594/9294/blii.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img594.imageshack.us/img594/9294/blii.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img198.imageshack.us/img198/1664/0equ.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img198.imageshack.us/img198/1664/0equ.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img194.imageshack.us/img194/422/m59l.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img194.imageshack.us/img194/422/m59l.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video: Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;4508242c2b0509766b74&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script data-cfhash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;data-cfhash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}t.parentNode.removeChild(t);}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n * Video: Bitrate: 1507 Kbps\n * Video: Aspect Ratio: 1.778 (16:9)\n * Video: Resolution: 832 x 468\n * Audio: Codec: AAC LC\n * Audio: Bitrate: 128 Kbps VBR 48KHz\n * Audio: Channels: stereo (2/0)\n * Audio: English\n * Run-Time: 59mins\n * Framerate: 25fps\n * Number of Parts: 4\n * Part Size: 695 MB\n * Container: Mp4\n * Source: PDTV\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01k4znz&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01k4znz&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:222ed352aadf2fb792c107ce22223b642f1affca","amp;dn":"Britain+and+the+Sea+Series+1+2of4+Invasion+and+Defence+PDTV+x264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"222ed352aadf2fb792c107ce22223b642f1affca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,46,211,82,170,223,47,183,146,193,7,206,34,34,59,100,47,26,255,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
