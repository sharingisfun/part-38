Rescued during a storm, Koko and Flynn are taken in by what amounts to a self-sufficient outlander cult. To save FlynnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life, Koko barters her warrior skills and assists the de-civ group in fending off their most imminent threat: a horde of genetic-mutant raiders. However, even with the groupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s foes bested and their idealist lifestyle somewhat enticing, being among the outlander de-civs doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t sit well with Koko. In spite of the de-civ groupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hospitality and FlynnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s arguing that they have it pretty good, Koko suspects something is amiss. People within the outlander groupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s interlocking compounds keep disappearing with flimsy explanationsÃ¢â‚¬â€people like the girl who died on the cliff before Koko and FlynnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rescueÃ¢â‚¬â€and soon the groupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s leadership assesses Koko as a threat to their secret agenda. As the mystery unfolds, KokoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s limits and loyaltiesÃ¢â‚¬â€perhaps even her love for FlynnÃ¢â‚¬â€will be tested.\n\nAnd as if that isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t enough, bounty agent Wire has managed to track down Koko and, after a little politicking, is preparing to lead an army of genetic-mutant raiders in a last-man-standing battle against the cult . . .\n\n\n\nRead by Hillary Huber\nFormat: MP3\nBitrate: 64 Kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e98ead89935d8e02180c8a9b51bfbc3e787031b0","amp;dn":"Kieran+Shea+-+Koko+the+Mighty+%28EBK+%232%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e98ead89935d8e02180c8a9b51bfbc3e787031b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,142,173,137,147,93,142,2,24,12,138,155,81,191,188,62,120,112,49,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
