Street Hassle - Waltzing Matilda/Street Hassle/Slipaway\n\nB-side:\nVelvet Underground\n02. I'm Waiting For The Man\n03. Venus In Furs \n\n&quot;Street Hassle&quot; is a song recorded by Lou Reed for his album of the same name. The song is 11 minutes long, divided into three distinct sections: Waltzing Matilda, Street Hassle, &amp; Slip Away. Part one, &quot;Waltzing Matilda,&quot; describes a woman picking up and paying a male prosititue. In Part Two, &quot;Street Hassle,&quot; a drug dealer monologues at length about the death of a woman (ostensibly &quot;Waltzing Matilda&quot;) in his apartment to her companion (presumably the male prosititue from Part One). Part Three, &quot;Slip Away,&quot; contains a brief spoken word section by Bruce Springsteen (from 9:02 to 9:39) and a dirge sung by Reed about love and death.\n\nThe cover is included but I had to scan it in two pieces and put them together in Photoshop. :)\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Abrasax/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Abrasax/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fde57e159cc05dafa49e517df6decfab4c501adc","amp;dn":"Lou+Reed-Street+Hassle-12+inch-Vinylrip-Abrasax","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fde57e159cc05dafa49e517df6decfab4c501adc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,229,126,21,156,192,93,175,164,158,81,125,246,222,207,171,76,80,26,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
