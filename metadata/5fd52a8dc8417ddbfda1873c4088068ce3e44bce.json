The overall feel is rural, with plenty of slide guitar slithering over raw, live rhythms. The hooks have a timeless feel, as on &quot;Keep Your Lamp Trimmed and Burning,&quot; with its rootsy gospel vocal motif and an implied handclap beat over a &quot;My Sharona&quot; hook. But Harris nods as well toward acoustic folk-blues, softened and broadened on the solo track &quot;Capitaine&quot; by an almost John Redbourne feel (which owes a lot in itself to Son House). Instrumental tracks evoke images nearly as clearly as those with words; the jump boogie bounce of &quot;BB&quot; paints a picture of a Southern roadhouse on a Saturday night. But when Harris adds lyrics they enhance this eloquence, as on &quot;Fire,&quot; whose references to Babylon, bloodshed, and perditional flames project an ominous, apocalyptic power. It's an easy leap for Harris from folklore to urgent urban settings; his depiction of a police car as a fearsome, prowling Biblical beast makes &quot;Santoro&quot; especially disturbing. The fact that Harris also borrows from Mexican and Latino traditions, especially on &quot;Sista Rose&quot; and the sensuous &quot;Black Maria,&quot; makes the point that African-American culture, the center of Western pop, abuts multiple styles and is able to draw from each with equal ease. In the end, the title says it all: This is music both primitive and elusive, easy to absorb and more difficult to play than it seems.
