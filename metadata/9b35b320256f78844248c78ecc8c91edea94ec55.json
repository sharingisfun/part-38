The cover caught my eye, and this has become one of my favorite finds over the years.\n\n3 Israeli, 1 American, rock&amp;#039;n&amp;#039;roll band. All the tunes have a Israeli, middle eastern feel to them, kind of like if the Ventures were from Tel-Aviv. The Sabras were formed in N.Y, some time in the late 60&amp;#039;s, and performed in the Catskills, and various Israeli night clubs in and around New York city.\n\nThe songs that really stand out are &quot;Falafel&quot; a theme song for vegetarians everywhere (sung in Hebrew and English) and Eastemen which is a turkish folk song. Every song here is good, enjoy!&quot;\n\n01 Yerushalayim Shel Zahav (4:04)\n02 Estemen (2:50)\n03 Haez Haboded (2:42)\n04 Ho Yaldonet (2:59)\n05 Cuando Caliente (3:33)\n06 Amer-Israeli Boogie Woogie (4:26)\n07 Israeli Medley (2:59)\n08 Erev Shel Shoshanim (3:09)\n09 Sallah (2:13)\n10 Zamar Noded (2:11)\n11 Falafel (3:11)\n12 La Bamba (2:51)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b35b320256f78844248c78ecc8c91edea94ec55","amp;dn":"The+Sabras+-+Jerusalem+of+Gold+Vinyl+Rip+60s+Israeli+Garage+Rock","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b35b320256f78844248c78ecc8c91edea94ec55","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,53,179,32,37,111,120,132,66,72,199,142,204,140,145,237,234,148,236,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
