It has some cult film buzz, mainly due to the movie's comparisons to the 1983 film Videodrome. It looked like it would be a borderline soft core porn version of Videodrome but it's actually a semi-intelligent mishmash of many science fiction and film noir elements that gets genuinely creepy at points. Pretty much every review for this movie compares it to Videodrome, so that may be a reason for seeing it. It's not really a whole lot like that film, but perhaps it is thematically similar. Actually, it's much more like Blade Runner crossed with 1984 with a bit of Blue Velvet thrown in. Maybe? It is definitely a strange one.\n\nThe movie follows the travails of a woman who comes to the big city to visit her sister, only to find her nude in the bathtub, dead as a door nail. Instead of, you know, letting the cops take care of this, she decides instead to go undercover at the monolithic corporation slash strip club where her sister was employed before her untimely demise. What she discovers isn't pretty. As a side business, the owner of the place is making weird sex/snuff tapes which look like they are outtakes from Sprockets and having bizarre drug-fueled orgies in the board room upstairs. How will out heroine get out of this one?\n\n\nVideo: DivX5, 640x480, 29.970 fps, 2200 Kbps, 01h32m33s\nAudio: MP3, 48000 Hz, joint stereo, 224 kbps\n\nVHSRip poor quality, English audio, no subtitles\n\ncover: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/df0ejrhkv/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/df0ejrhkv/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nscreenshots: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/z5siwpdwn/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/z5siwpdwn/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/9e2ltrhk7/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/9e2ltrhk7/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/we9963fdz/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/we9963fdz/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/z72gq4fqf/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/z72gq4fqf/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9e8be678ecbb07039c8c54f09ec6609f614241b","amp;dn":"Liquid+Dreams+-+1991+%28cult+science+fiction+thriller%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9e8be678ecbb07039c8c54f09ec6609f614241b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,232,190,103,142,203,176,112,57,200,197,79,9,236,102,9,246,20,36,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
