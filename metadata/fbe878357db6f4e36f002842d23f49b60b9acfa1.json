(Bullet Swaging is the process of making your own projectiles for handloading or reloading using a reloading press.) Corbin insists on a really annoying sound track when you launch the CD, but that's Corbin. He's a tool &amp; die maker, not a web developer.\n\nBurn each .ISO to a CD. (They are tiny, but each has a menu, a PDF, and a few other formats of the book along with the previously mentioned annoying sound track.)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fbe878357db6f4e36f002842d23f49b60b9acfa1","amp;dn":"Corbin+Bullet+Swaging+CDs+-+reloading%2C+handloading%2C+ammo%2C+weapon","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fbe878357db6f4e36f002842d23f49b60b9acfa1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,232,120,53,125,182,244,227,111,0,40,66,210,63,73,182,11,154,207,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
