How far away they are is a question that has confounded scientists for centuries. Over the last few hundred years, many scientific careers ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and considerable resources ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ have been devoted to measuring their positions and motions with ever increasing accuracy. And in the last two decades of the 20th century, the European Space Agency developed and launched the Hipparcos satellite, around which this account revolves, to carry out these exacting measurements from space.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a158983c849706a204c4898b3de596082ee5f03a","amp;dn":"The+Making+of+History%5C%27s+Greatest+Star+Map+%282010%29+-+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a158983c849706a204c4898b3de596082ee5f03a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,88,152,60,132,151,6,162,4,196,137,139,61,229,150,8,46,229,240,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
