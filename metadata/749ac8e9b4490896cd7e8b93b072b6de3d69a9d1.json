Plenty of topical and amazing gags, several arguments about football, some fairly merciless banter, a chat about all the funny and crazy things youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve seen and done that week Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and of course, a frank discussion about the beauty and general awesomeness of women. Fortunately, such a magazine exists. ZOO, the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best selling menÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s weekly magazine, is all about the things that bring men together Ã¢â‚¬â€œ all those things that we are proud to say make us normal blokes.\n\n\nZOO UK - Issue 519, 27 March 2014 \nLanguage: English \nPages: 70\nFile Type: Pdf\nFile Size: 43.5 MB\n\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/Nr9BEiL.jpg[/IMG]\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/Nr9BEiL.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/Nr9BEiL.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:749ac8e9b4490896cd7e8b93b072b6de3d69a9d1","amp;dn":"ZOO+UK+-+Issue+519%2C+27+March+2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"749ac8e9b4490896cd7e8b93b072b6de3d69a9d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,154,200,233,180,73,8,150,205,126,139,147,176,114,182,222,61,105,169,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
