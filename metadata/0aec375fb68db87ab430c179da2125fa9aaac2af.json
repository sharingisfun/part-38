Had he read of the discovery of the man's body in the street? Perhaps he had fled already? Not a sound was to be heard there. He did not look in the least like what Jane imagined a murderer would, yet certainly the circumstances pointed all too plainly to his guilt. She had seen two men dash around the corner, one in pursuit of the other. One of them had come back alone. Not long afterward a body--the body of the other man--had been found with a bullet in his heart. It must have been a murder.\n\nWhat ought she to do about it? Was it her duty to tell her mother and Dad about what she had seen? Mother, she knew, would be horrified and would caution her to say nothing to any one, but Dad was different. He had strict ideas about right and justice. He would insist on hearing every word she had to tell","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0aec375fb68db87ab430c179da2125fa9aaac2af","amp;dn":"The+Apartment+Next+Door","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0aec375fb68db87ab430c179da2125fa9aaac2af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,236,55,95,182,141,184,122,180,48,193,121,218,33,37,250,154,170,194,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
