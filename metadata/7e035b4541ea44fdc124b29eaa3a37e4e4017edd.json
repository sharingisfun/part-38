That being said, I feel comfortable uploading it here even though it's not mine. The torrent contains seven live shows from 2000 to 2006. They are:\n\n2000-11-14 - Courtyard Cafe, Urbana, IL\n2001-01-17 - Fireside Bowl, Chicago, IL\n2002-11-21 - Shuba's, Chicago, IL\n2003-02-05 - Unknown Venue, Detroit, MI\n2003-02-08 - Courtyard Cafe, Urbana, IL\n2005-04-05 - Maxwell's, Hoboken, NJ\n2006-05-02 - The North Bar, Philadelphia, PA\n\nIf you're interested in more live Owen recordings, in this case videos, I have collected the best quality youtube recordings of live Mike Kinsella. Just search for &quot;Owen, or Mike Kinsella's Band.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e035b4541ea44fdc124b29eaa3a37e4e4017edd","amp;dn":"Mike+Kinsella+-+Owen+-+Bootlegs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e035b4541ea44fdc124b29eaa3a37e4e4017edd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,3,91,69,65,234,68,253,193,36,178,158,170,58,55,228,228,1,126,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
