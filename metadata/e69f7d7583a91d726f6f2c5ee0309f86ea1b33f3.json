(1995)\n\nTenor saxophonist Illinois Jacquet has never made an indifferent record, and this CD reissue of a Prestige date from 1968 has its strong moments. High points include the rousing, if overly brief &quot;The King,&quot; and a warm &quot;Blue and Sentimental,&quot; and an atmospheric feature on &quot;Caravan&quot; for Jacquet's bassoon. On the other hand, this version of &quot;How High the Moon&quot; does not live up to its potential, and the two other songs (&quot;A Haunting Melody&quot; and &quot;I Wish I Knew How It Would Feel to Be Free&quot;) are a bit dated. Two previously unissued alternate takes are included on the still rather brief (41 minutes) CD, which also has worthwhile contributions from trumpeter Joe Newman, pianist Milt Buckner and guitarist Billy Butler. Enjoyable music but not all that essential. (AllMusic)\n\nTrack list:\n01. A Haunting Melody\n02. I Wish I Knew How It Would Feel To Be Free\n03. How High the Moon\n04. The King\n05.
