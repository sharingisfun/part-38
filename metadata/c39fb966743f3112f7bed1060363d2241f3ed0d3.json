In six 15-minute episodes, Brody Stevens: Enjoy It!  follows Brody after a maniacal meltdown (that fans and the world witnessed via Twitter), precipitated by Brody going off his drugs.  Out of the UCLA psych ward, back on his meds, and trying to get his stand-up and film career back on track, Brody makes the rounds in LA, with pal Zach Galifianakis and others in tow, reconnecting and reconciling with the recognizable faces in the biz that he'd let down.  A mix of live stand-up scenes, &quot;documentary&quot; footage, and humorous animation to enhance Brody's frenetic stories, Brody Stevens is a dark and funny comedy - so sit back and Enjoy It!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c39fb966743f3112f7bed1060363d2241f3ed0d3","amp;dn":"Brody+Stevens+Enjoy+It","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c39fb966743f3112f7bed1060363d2241f3ed0d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,159,185,102,116,63,49,18,247,190,209,6,3,99,210,36,31,62,208,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
