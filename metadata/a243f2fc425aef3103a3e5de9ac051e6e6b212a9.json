Can that faith save him? If a brother or sister is poorly clothed and lacking in daily food, and one of you says to them, â€˜Go in peace, be warmed and filled,â€™ without giving them the things needed for the body, what good is that? So also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead.â€ â€“James 2:14-17 (ESV)\r\n\r\nTwelve people. Twelve lives. Twelve different stories. What do all of these people have in common? A yearning, a desire, a calling to be more than how the world views them. â€œDo You Believe?â€ takes viewers into the lives of each of these people. An EMS worker persecuted for sharing the Gospel with a dying man. Parents grieving over the loss of their daughter. A man trying to start a life off the streets. A girl dealing a teen pregnancy alone. A veteran trying to return home. A daughter, abandoned by her own family. A mother and her child fighting homelessness on their own. Each of these people will have to ask themselves the ultimate question of all time, â€œDoâ€¦â€¦youâ€¦â€¦ believe?â€\r\n\r\nThese three simple words strike the very core of the Christian faith. They beg us to look not only at our lives as a private intimate relationship with the Almighty, but to be driven by the immense joy of being Godâ€™s own to share and spread that faith to others. It means giving our livesâ€”serving as examples of Christâ€™s love. It means living a life so complete that people see the difference in you, see the hope in your eyes, see the example and say, â€œWhat is it that makes you the way you are?â€\r\n\r\nThat is the stance â€œDo You Believe?â€ takes. Powerfully told through good performances, â€œDo You Believeâ€ is a film that may shake your soul to the very core (it was created by the same team behind â€œGodâ€™s Not Deadâ€). As I sat in the theater, I sat on the edge of my seat as I watched each story unravel and intensify. At the end, I felt this pull, this urge inside, to shout, â€œYes, I believe!â€ Each of these stories are genuine, every day stories that can happen, and the fact that they CAN happen and the power that the Cross make this movie that much more riveting and powerful.\r\n\r\nI would rank Do You Believeâ€™s cinematic qualities at the same level of the everyday Hollywood film. As I said the performances by each and every character are powerful and impressive. The camerawork is excellent as well, providing appropriate angles for each of the different scenarios. The pacing of the story is well done, not too fast and not to slow. In fact, I didnâ€™t even notice 90 minutes go by, a rare occurrence indeed.\r\n\r\nâ€œBelief takes you to your knees, then raises you to your feet,â€ says Pastor Matthew in this film.\r\nContent Issues\r\n\r\nViolence: There are scenes involving gunfire and one character is killed in the process. One character bleeds to death. There is a car chase scene involving the police. There is also a scene involving an explosion. The film also deals with suicide (including â€œcuttingâ€).\r\n\r\nSex/Nudity: Minor. A couple shares a kiss, and one of the unmarried characters is pregnant.\r\n\r\nâ€œDo You Believe?â€ is a powerful, well written and performed, thought-provoking film serving as a testimony and a reminder to all of usâ€¦ what are you willing to give up for the cross? I strongly recommend this film for viewing by all Christian families.\r\n\r\nAnd in closing, I leave you with this Scriptureâ€¦\r\n\r\n    â€œThen said Jesus unto his disciples, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow meâ€ â€”Matthew 16:24.\r\n\r\nViolence: Moderate / Profanity: None / Sex/Nudity: Minor","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a243f2fc425aef3103a3e5de9ac051e6e6b212a9","amp;dn":"Do+You+Believe+-+2015","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a243f2fc425aef3103a3e5de9ac051e6e6b212a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,67,242,252,66,90,239,49,3,163,229,222,154,192,81,230,230,178,18,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
