Choose from a variety of ships, each equipped with unique features and abilities. Embark on your mission to tunnel through the strengthening alien invasion, find itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s source, and save the galaxy! Go it alone or assemble a squad of your friends to battle in the most unforgiving corners of the universe!\n\n\nIn Galacide, you must carefully strike a balance between fighting the enemy and tunneling through the encroaching Bitwall, as neglecting either will assuredly result in your demise. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll take a combination of skill, luck, and an advanced spacecraft to ensure your success, so choosing the right craft for your piloting style is key:\n\n    Mining Ship - A retrofitted asteroid mining vessel, this ship has a solid balance of agility, strength, and firepower, and is equipped with a powerful tractor beam used to pull in enemy Scrap.\n    Freighter - A re-purposed cargo-hauler, this ship may not be the fastest or hit enemies the hardest, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s as durable as they come, with the ability store &amp; retrieve enemy scrap in its cache.\n    Phase Ship - A top-secret military experiment, this ship is able to move extraordinarily fast and temporarily phase through the Bitwall, while dodging enemy attacks.\n    Military Ship - The accepted standard for military conflict, this ship boasts huge strength and firepower. Homing missiles lock on targets, and the ability to burst through the Bitwall, carving its own path","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:326299271d330551f5ffc6917b73da010edfaa58","amp;dn":"Galacide","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"326299271d330551f5ffc6917b73da010edfaa58","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,98,153,39,29,51,5,81,245,255,198,145,123,115,218,1,14,223,170,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
