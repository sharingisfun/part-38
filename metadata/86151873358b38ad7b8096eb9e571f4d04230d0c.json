And morning and evening, the beautiful commuter acknowledges himÃ¢â‚¬â€just like she does everyone else on the platform. But Blake Hartt is not like the others . . . heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s homeless. Memories of a broken childhood have robbed him of peace and twisted delusions into his soul. He stays secluded from the sun, sure the world would run from him in the harsh light of day. \n\nEach day, Livia McHugh smiles politely and acknowledges her fellow commuters as she waits for the train to the city. She dismisses this kindness as nothing special, just like her. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the same as a million other girlsÃ¢â‚¬â€certainly no one to be cherished. But special or not, she smiles every day, never imagining that someone would rely on the simple gesture as if it were air to breathe.\n\nWhen the moment comes that Livia must do more than smile, without hesitation she steps into the fray to defend the homeless man. And she's surprised to discover an inexplicable connection with her new friend. After danger subsides, their smiles become conversation. Their words usher in a friendship, which awakens something in each of them. But itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not long before their bond must prove its strength. Entanglements from the past challenge both their love and their lives.\n\nBlakeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s heart beats for LiviaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s, even if her hands have to keep its rhythm. Love is patient. Love is kind. Love never fails. Love never fails, right?\n\nIn an interwoven tale of unlikely loves and relationships forged by fire, Debra Anastasia takes readers into the darkest corners of human existence, only to show them the radiant power of pure adoration and true sacrifice. Complicated families and confused souls find their way to light in this novel, which manages to be racy, profane, funny, and reverent all at once.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:86151873358b38ad7b8096eb9e571f4d04230d0c","amp;dn":"Debra+Anastasia++Poughkeepsie++2011+ebook++%5Bepub%5D+romanc++thrill","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"86151873358b38ad7b8096eb9e571f4d04230d0c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,21,24,115,53,139,56,173,123,128,150,235,158,87,31,77,4,35,13,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
