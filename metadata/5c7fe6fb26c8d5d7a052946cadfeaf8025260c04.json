How can you ensure you always get the best quality and service? And what techniques do restaurants use to get us to spend more?\r\n\r\n\r\n1)  Burgers \r\nIn this episode, presenter Kate Quilton and Chef Simon Rimmer examine the increasing popularity of burger chains. With inside access to a high-end burger chain, Kate finds out what it is that makes their burgers `gourmet'. The programme also looks at the growing trend of serving burgers cooked rare, and Simon demonstrates the common tricks of the trade that are used to turn a profit.\r\n\r\n2)  Pizzas \r\nThe team puts British pizzas to the test, comparing two very non-traditional pizzas from takeaway chain Papa John's with an authentic Italian pizza, and asking diners at an Italian restaurant which they prefer. Kate Quilton spends an afternoon having tea at The Ritz, which costs Â£50 a head, but when she takes over an east London cafe to recreate her own version of high tea, the ingredients cost less than Â£7 per person. Plus, Simon Rimmer commandeers a popular bistro in Manchester to demonstrate the common tricks of the trade that help restaurants make a profit.\r\n\r\n3)  Cocktails \r\nThe team reveal the extent to which the public end up eating pre-prepared meals, desserts and cocktails served in restaurants, which are ordered in from outside caterers. Kate Quilton tests whether she can tell the difference between a fresh cocktail and one that comes ready-made in a carton, Simon Rimmer demonstrates how restaurants can remake a dish from something that failed to sell the day before and Adam Pearson finds out the mark-up price of the humble hamburger and chips.\r\n\r\n4)  Fried Chicken \r\nKate Quilton and Simon Rimmer examine the chicken market, focusing on the two big players, KFC and Nando's. As well as sampling his first KFC, Simon attempts to recreate Colonel Sanders' famous secret recipe. Meanwhile, Kate visits Moy Park, one of the largest poultry providers in the country, to see some of the birds destined for KFC.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/ed/Tricks-of-the-Restaurant-Trade-Series-1-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c8/Tricks-of-the-Restaurant-Trade-Series-1-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/1e/Tricks-of-the-Restaurant-Trade-Series-1-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/9b/Tricks-of-the-Restaurant-Trade-Series-1-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/de/Tricks-of-the-Restaurant-Trade-Series-1-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/ac/Tricks-of-the-Restaurant-Trade-Series-1-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/20/Tricks-of-the-Restaurant-Trade-Series-1-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c1/Tricks-of-the-Restaurant-Trade-Series-1-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a5/Tricks-of-the-Restaurant-Trade-Series-1-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/fe/Tricks-of-the-Restaurant-Trade-Series-1-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/93/Tricks-of-the-Restaurant-Trade-Series-1-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/fa/Tricks-of-the-Restaurant-Trade-Series-1-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/76/Tricks-of-the-Restaurant-Trade-Series-1-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e0/Tricks-of-the-Restaurant-Trade-Series-1-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a7/Tricks-of-the-Restaurant-Trade-Series-1-Screen14.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/28/Tricks-of-the-Restaurant-Trade-Series-1-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 3183 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 25mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 4\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 542 MB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.radiotimes.com/programme/dwyspx/tricks-of-the-restaurant-trade/episodeguide/series-1","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c7fe6fb26c8d5d7a052946cadfeaf8025260c04","amp;dn":"Ch4+Tricks+Of+The+Restaurant+Trade+Series+1+4of4+Fried+Chicken+7","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c7fe6fb26c8d5d7a052946cadfeaf8025260c04","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,127,230,251,38,200,213,215,160,82,148,108,173,254,175,128,37,38,12,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
