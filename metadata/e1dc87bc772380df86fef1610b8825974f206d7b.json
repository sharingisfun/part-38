With his brother, drummer Vinnie Abbott, he formed Pantera, becoming one of the most popular bands of the Ã¢â‚¬â„¢90s and selling millions of albums to an intensely devoted fan base. While the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s music was aggressive, Ã¢â‚¬Å“DimeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ was outgoing, gregarious, and adored by everyone who knew him.\n\nFrom PanteraÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s heyday to their implosion following singer Phil AnselmoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s heroin addiction to DarrellÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tragic end, Black Tooth Grin is a moving portrait of a great artist.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e1dc87bc772380df86fef1610b8825974f206d7b","amp;dn":"Black+Tooth+Grin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e1dc87bc772380df86fef1610b8825974f206d7b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,220,135,188,119,35,128,223,134,254,241,97,11,136,37,151,79,32,109,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
