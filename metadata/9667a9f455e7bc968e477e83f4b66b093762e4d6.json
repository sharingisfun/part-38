We have had our fill of tasteless, woody tomatoes from the far reaches of the globe and have begun tasting againÃ¢â‚¬â€thanks to farmersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ markets and co-opsÃ¢â‚¬â€the real flavors we remember from childhood.\nInspired by these events, people have started growing food in the most unlikely places, including rooftops, abandoned parking lots, and tiny balconies and backyards on average city streets. Individuals and families are taking up the trowel and discovering that gardening can be fun, fulfilling, and, ultimately, delicious. Far from sacrificing their ornamental flowers, creative gardeners can discover the joy of growing food in beautiful, thoughtful gardens overflowing with both color and flavor.\n Creating an attractive and productive garden in your small space might seem impossible, but throughout this book, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll see examples of some wonderful things that can be done, from interesting plant combinations to unique structures and planting beds. If you can banish the thought that vegetables and fruits must be grown in rows and open up to the idea that a tomato plant can be a striking addition to your landscape plan, The Edible Landscape will help you explore some ideas for transforming your yard into a feast for both the eyes and the table.\n\nAbout the Author &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/ciu/e6/98/28d8d99bce8b0ad8976f8e.L._V394449400_SX200_.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/ciu/e6/98/28d8d99bce8b0ad8976f8e.L._V394449400_SX200_.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\nAs a fruit research associate at the University of Minnesota, and former mural artist and exhibit designer, Emily Tepe looks at the world with both a practical and creative eye.
