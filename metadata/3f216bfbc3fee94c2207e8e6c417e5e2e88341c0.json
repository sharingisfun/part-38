Atmospheric, contemplative and serene, with slow-moving\ntempos. It is music for dreaming and relaxing, music for accompanying the views\nof nature.\n\nI discovered Max Corbacho&amp;#039;s rich atmospheric music by chance just as I had \nfound Robert Scott Thompson&amp;#039;s masterpieces of computer generated ambience a \nyear or so ago. Max is a Spaniard whose musical directions certainly are \nstrongly influenced by RST, and also Steve Roach and Michael Stearns. But \nthere is magic lurking in the textured landscapes of sound that Max Corbacho \ncan deliver. There is a depth in his hypnotic layers of ambience that is \nrarely found anywhere in the world of new age music.And also a challenging \nvariety of sounds as this exciting display of music moves though space and \ntime. In the first three tracks Corbacho delivers a rhythm layed with \nsoothing rich textures that simply fill one with calm and delight. The track \n&amp;#039;Night Caravan&amp;#039; is one of the most magnificent pieces of ambient music I have \never heard.\n\nThen the aural topography changes to almost tribal rhythms on &amp;#039;erosion&amp;#039; that \none can imagine in a remote and desolate desert.From which one then returns \nto more familiar slopes of &amp;#039;Quietness&amp;#039; or succumb in Corbacho&amp;#039;s &amp;#039;Death \nValley&amp;#039;. The work ends in triumph or despair in the climax of &amp;#039;Vestiges&amp;#039; \nwhere silence becomes buried forever in a catastrophic thundering finale.\n\n-Amazon.com\n\n\n======================================================================\n.NFO file created with NFO Sighting V1.0.469 on 12/16/2006 at 5:26 PM\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f216bfbc3fee94c2207e8e6c417e5e2e88341c0","amp;dn":"Max+Corbacho+-+1998+-+Vestiges+%5BNew+Age%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f216bfbc3fee94c2207e8e6c417e5e2e88341c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,33,107,251,195,254,233,76,34,7,232,230,196,23,229,226,232,131,65,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
