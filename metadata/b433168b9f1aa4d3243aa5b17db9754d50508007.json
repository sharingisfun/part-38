Since itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s origin in the early 1980ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s these beliefs have spread all over the world, connected through the Punk and Hardcore music scenes.\nThrough interviews with musicians that directly shaped the idea of Straight Edge from its inception until today, EDGE ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ perspectives on drug free culture reveals that the abstinence from drugs was established as a youth counter culture rejecting a society dominated by substance abuse and hegemony.\tIan MacKaye (Minor Threat, Fugazi), Ray Cappo (Youth of Today, Shelter) and Karl Buechner (Earth Crisis, Freya) give witness to their perception of the history of Straight Edge, why it was so important to them and what it changed in their personal and professional careers. But they also address problems like violence, sexism and intolerance that emerged within Straight Edge, and how it changed the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“sceneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ as well as its public image.\nFurthermore, EDGE explores the lives of 9 individuals, that identify as Straight Edge. Their reasons range from negative experiences with drugs to maintaining a healthy lifestyle to political reasons. Through a very close and personal look into their daily lives, we see how their decision to live ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“poison freeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ has changed the world for them.\nBut how do people discover Straight Edge? How do women experience Straight Edge subculture? What social backgrounds are shared by people new to the scene and what makes someone turn Straight Edge? How does mainstream culture perceive this movement?\nEDGE is looking for answers to these questions on a roadtrip behind and beyond the scenes of the Straight Edge subculture.\n\n******\n\n\nIF YOU LIKE THIS FILM PLEASE BUY IT TO SUPPORT ITS MAKERS\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.theedgeprojectmovie.com/?page_id=837&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.theedgeprojectmovie.com/?page_id=837&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b433168b9f1aa4d3243aa5b17db9754d50508007","amp;dn":"EDGE+the+movie.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b433168b9f1aa4d3243aa5b17db9754d50508007","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,51,22,139,159,26,164,211,36,58,165,177,125,185,117,77,80,80,128,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
