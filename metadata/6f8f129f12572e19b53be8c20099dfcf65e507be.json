However, in MDNA GamesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ AmberÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Blood, Carol gets far more than she bargained for when she tries to help a friend learn about the macabre mystery behind her grandfatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s death. While this modest, thoroughly traditional point-and-click slideshow adventure doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t hold any surprises in the gameplay or presentation department, it does hold a shock or two as you investigate a fascinating mystery that slowly develops over time and provides a satisfying tale full of twists and turns.\n\nGiven Carol's typical pattern of peaceful summers shattered by mysteries that need solving, now she'd settle just for sleeping in and having a peaceful day. But even these simple pleasures prove elusive when her good friend Stina becomes intrigued by an obituary for a certain Alfons Larson while searching through her fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s attic after his death. Larson may have been her grandfather, only the date on the obituary is much later than what her family had led her to believe about his death. Unfortunately, Stina injures herself in a fall and must enlist CarolÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s help to pursue the matter further. And so Carol finds her summer reverie broken by a mystery that starts out small but increasingly puts her in the line of danger.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.adventuregamers.com/images/screenshots/17329/21519__full.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.adventuregamers.com/images/screenshots/17329/21519__full.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.adventuregamers.com/images/screenshots/17329/21517__full.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.adventuregamers.com/images/screenshots/17329/21517__full.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.adventuregamers.com/images/screenshots/17329/21515__full.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.adventuregamers.com/images/screenshots/17329/21515__full.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f8f129f12572e19b53be8c20099dfcf65e507be","amp;dn":"Amber%26acute%3Bs+Blood+-+Full+PreCracked+-+Foxy+Games","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f8f129f12572e19b53be8c20099dfcf65e507be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,143,18,159,18,87,46,25,181,59,232,194,0,153,223,207,101,229,7,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
