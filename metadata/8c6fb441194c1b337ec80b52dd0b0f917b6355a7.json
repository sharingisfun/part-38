God sees you as a precious treasure, and He longs to have a close relationship with you. More than anything He wants you to have an intimate love relationship and friendship with Him. God wants you to spend time with Him and intimately communicate with Him, to enjoy fellowship with Him, to trust and follow Him, and to give your life meaning and purpose by giving you the privilege of joining Him in His work.\n\n\n\nDo you desire a deeper and closer relationship and friendship with God ? Is your desire to know Him and to please Him growing ? Do you know that hearing God's voice is by far the most important part of your prayer &amp; fellowship time with God ? God needs to touch our hearts so that Jesus is our 1st Love, and so that we will faithfully and passionately seek Him and follow Him, however and wherever He may lead us.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c6fb441194c1b337ec80b52dd0b0f917b6355a7","amp;dn":"Building+Deep+-+Intimacy+with+God","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c6fb441194c1b337ec80b52dd0b0f917b6355a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,111,180,65,25,76,27,51,126,200,11,82,221,11,15,145,123,99,85,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
