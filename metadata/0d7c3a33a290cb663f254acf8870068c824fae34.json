Now Republicans in the Senate will add amendments to the billÃ¢â‚¬â€they want to turn it from a bill that outlaws discrimination to a bill that outlaws SOME discrimination. The bill exempts religious employers from its antidiscrimination rules. So if the bill passes, you canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be a bigot unless youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re a religious bigot. Progress! Unfortunately, it looks like the bill is going nowhere in the House. Or more accurately, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s going to the House, which is nowhere. Speaker Boehner has already expressed his opposition to the bill. To be more accurate, he expressed the opposition of the House Tea Party caucus, not his own opposition. But thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s functionally the same thing.\n\nToday is Election Day in several places. Both Chris Christie and Ken Cuccinelli are running for governorshipsÃ¢â‚¬â€itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s like the Republicans are playing the old Ã¢â‚¬Å“good cop, bad copÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ game with voters. Actually, since weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re talking about Republicans, I guess it would be Ã¢â‚¬Å“bad cop, worse cop.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ It shows you just how far the GOP has fallen that a union-busting enemy of working people like Chris Christie represents the moderate, reasonable side of the Party.\n\nMeanwhile in Virginia, Republicans are trying to frame the gubernatorial race as a referendum on Obamacare, which is not a good idea. But allowing it to be a referendum on Ken Cuccinelli is even worse. Cuccinelli is best known for his efforts to make sodomy illegal again in Virginia. The irony there is that the extremist activists in the Virginia Republican Party forced Cuccinelli down the throats of the state GOP.\n\nKentucky, of all places, is showing how smoothly things can go when the implementation of the ACA isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t being attacked. In Kentucky, the state-run exchange is called Kynect and the navigators who assist people are called Kynectors. If only Florida was cooperating with the healthcare rollout. They could call the system Ã¢â‚¬Å“Fla-cilitateÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and call the navigators Ã¢â‚¬Å“Fla-cilitators.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ OK, maybe that wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be such a great idea. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Fla-cilitateÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ sounds like something Rush Limbaugh takes for erectile dysfunction.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d7c3a33a290cb663f254acf8870068c824fae34","amp;dn":"Randi+Rhodes+Show+-+November+05+2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d7c3a33a290cb663f254acf8870068c824fae34","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,124,58,51,162,144,203,102,63,37,74,207,136,112,6,140,130,79,174,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
