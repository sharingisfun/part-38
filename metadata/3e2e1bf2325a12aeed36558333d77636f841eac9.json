Why did the Buddha walk to Sarnath to give his first sermon ? How did the Europeans map India ?\n\nThe history of any country begins with its geography. With sparkling wit and intelligence, Sanjeev Sanyal sets off to explore India and look at how the countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s history was shaped by, among other things, its rivers, mountains and cities. Traversing remote mountain passes, visiting ancient archaeological sites, crossing rivers in shaky boats and immersing himself in old records and manuscripts, he considers questions about Indian history that we rarely ask : Why do Indians call their country Bharat ? How did the British build the railways across the subcontinent ? What was it like to sail on an Indian Ocean merchant ship in the fifth century AD ? Why was the world's highest mountain named after George Everest ?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e2e1bf2325a12aeed36558333d77636f841eac9","amp;dn":"Land+of+The+Seven+Rivers+-+Sanjeev+Sanyal.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e2e1bf2325a12aeed36558333d77636f841eac9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,46,27,242,50,90,18,174,237,54,85,131,51,215,118,54,248,65,234,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
