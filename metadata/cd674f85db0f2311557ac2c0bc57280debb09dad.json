All are members of the notorious 27 Club: they all died prematurely young at the age of 27. Their stories are fascinating pieces of music trivia, but Sounes (Fab, 2010) is interested in why they behaved the way they did. What specifically made them so self-destructive? (Sounes includes an appendix of an additional 44 members of the 27 Club, including the bluesman Robert Johnson.) Although only Cobain deliberately committed suicide, Sounes argues that all six killed themselves. All were intelligent and talented, he maintains, but most had personality problems of some sort, such as depression or bipolar disorder; in addition, many were the children of divorced parents and had low self-esteem. Fans of these musicians will be intrigued and saddened by this fascinating and tragic account.\n\nBy Howard Sounes\nPublished by Da Capo Press in 2013\nEPUB, Retail, 384 pages, English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd674f85db0f2311557ac2c0bc57280debb09dad","amp;dn":"27%3AA+History+of+the+27+Club+%28ePUB%2CRetail%29+%7B32Skulls%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd674f85db0f2311557ac2c0bc57280debb09dad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,103,79,133,219,15,35,17,85,122,194,192,188,87,40,13,235,176,157,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
