Saved by the pharaoh's daughter Bithiah, he is adopted by her and brought up in the court of her brother, Pharaoh Seti. Moses gains Seti's favor and the love of the throne princess Nefertiri, as well as the hatred of Seti's son, Rameses. When his Hebrew heritage is revealed, Moses is cast out of Egypt, and makes his way across the desert where he marries, has a son and is commanded by God to return to Egypt to free the Hebrews from slavery. In Egypt Moses's fiercest enemy proves to be not Rameses, but someone near to him who can 'harden his heart'. \n\n\nSubtitles: Croatian, Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, Norwegian, Portugese, Spanish, Swedish, Turkish\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0049833/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0049833/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/sublanguageid-all/idmovie-5738&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/sublanguageid-all/idmovie-5738&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 544x320\nCodec : DivX (4 / 5 / 6)\nFPS : 25,00\nBitRate : 1377 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,32 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 128 Kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1373a13adaa96cdd06515831bec54561e97c7dd1","amp;dn":"Ten+Commandments%2C+The+%5B1956%5BEn.De.It.Es.Fr+Multisubs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1373a13adaa96cdd06515831bec54561e97c7dd1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,115,161,58,218,169,108,221,6,81,88,49,190,197,69,97,233,124,125,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
