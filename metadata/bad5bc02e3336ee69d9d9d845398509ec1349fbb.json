That tawdry celebration of sex is what made AC/DC different from all other metal bands ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ there was no sword &amp; sorcery, no darkness, just a rowdy party, and they never held a bigger, better party than they did on Back in Black.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bad5bc02e3336ee69d9d9d845398509ec1349fbb","amp;dn":"AC%2FDC+-+Back+in+Black+-+1980","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bad5bc02e3336ee69d9d9d845398509ec1349fbb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,213,188,2,227,51,110,230,157,157,157,132,83,152,80,158,193,52,159,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
