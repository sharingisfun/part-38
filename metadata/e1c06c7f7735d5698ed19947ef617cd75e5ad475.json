Formed during the summer of 2008 in Fairfax, Virginia, the band originally consisted of high-school students Cameron Leahy and Eric Jones. Classmate David Pavluk joined several months later, handling bass duties and singing backup for frontman Leahy. A healthy following on MySpace helped the boys land a contract with Photo Finish Records in 2009, and the band spent the latter half of that year working on new music. By early 2010, theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d made their iTunes debut with Best I Never Had, an introductory EP that helped them land several summer tours, including the Bamboozle Road Show and the Vans Warped Tour. A second release, The Double E.P., arrived later that year, followed in 2011 by the full-length Let's Be Animals.\n\nTracks:\n\n 1. Thanks for Nothing\n 2. Freak\n 3. Stoned\n 4.
