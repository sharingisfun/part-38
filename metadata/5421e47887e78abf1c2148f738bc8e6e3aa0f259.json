YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll notice a different on this volume though;  most songs are quirky new wave and 80s funk or cool power pop and MOD. You might ask yourself what the heck is going on here? Okay, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s to celebrate 7th year anniversary of my uploads here. Yes 7 years ago this day I started this crazy thing of sharing music with the world. A kind of madness that got a hold of me somehow! Anyways, I think a lot was achieved and many forgotten bands found a new audience. So relax and enjoy this ultra happy mix of cool 80s tunes.
