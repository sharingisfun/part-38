My name is Casey Kasem and we're doing our weekly survey of the most popular records in the country as computed by Billboard Magazine, and on we go.&quot;\n\nAmerican Top 40 with Casey Kasem aired on radio from July 4, 1970 until August 6, 1988. This is a recording of a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nAs of this broadcast:\n\nThere is a song in the countdown where possession of the record (in fact, the entire album) was a crime in South Africa in May of 1980. Casey tells the story.\n\nCasey answers the question, &quot;What song holds the record for most weeks in the top ten without ever hitting number one?&quot; Casey says 17 weeks.\n\nThe first father/daughter duet of the rock era is in the countdown.\n\nA listener wants to know, &quot;Have any songs about God ever made it big on the pop chart?&quot; Casey says 6 songs about God have made the top five, and one of those was by a Catholic Nun. Then there is one more detail that Casey says, &quot;... must just be a coincidence.&quot;\n\nBlondie has the first hit of the 80's to spend more than four weeks at number one.\n\nFinally, a  listener wants to know, &quot;What album in the rock era has taken the most weeks to hit number one on the LP chart?&quot; Casey says the average album takes 7 weeks to hit number one, but this one took 58 weeks to get there, and it included the hit song, &quot;Rhiannon.&quot;\n\nLW#3: Lost In Love - Air Supply\nLW#2: Ride Like The Wind - Christopher Cross\nLW#1: Call Me - Blondie\n40:    We Live For Love - Pat Benetar\n39:    I Don't Want To Walk Without You - Barry Manilow\n38:    Special Lady - Ray, Goodman &amp; Brown        \n37:    Hold On To My Love - Jimmy Ruffin     \n36:    Starting Over Again - Dolly Parton     \n35:    Headed For A Fall - Firefall    \n34:    Gee Whiz - Bernadette Peters\n33:    Should've Never Let You Go - Neil Sedaka &amp; Dara Sedaka\nARCHIVES: Reunited - Peaches &amp; Herb\n32:    Wondering Where The Lions Are - Bruce Cockburn\n31:    Let Me Be The Clock - Smokey Robinson\n30:    The Seduction - The James Last Band\nLDD: Leaving On A Jet Plane - Peter, Paul &amp; Mary\n29:    Let's Get Serious Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Jermaine Jackson    \n28:    I CanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Tell You Why - The Eagles\n27:    Little Jeannie - Elton John\n26:    She's Out Of My Life - Michael Jackson\n25:    Train In Vain - The Clash\n24:    Fire Lake - Bob Seger\n23:    Do Right - Paul Davis\nARCHIVES: Hot Stuff - Donna Summer\n22:    Heart Hotels - Dan Fogelberg\n21:    Steal Away - Robbie Dupree\n20:    The Rose - Bette Midler\n19:    Coming Up - Paul McCartney\n18:    Against The Wind - Bob Seger &amp; The Silver Bullet Band\n17:    Brass In Pocket - The Pretenders\n16:    Stomp - The Brothers Johnson\n15:    Breakdown Dead Ahead - Boz Scaggs\n14:    Pilot Of The Airwaves - Charlie Dore\n13:    I Can't Help It - Andy Gibb &amp; Olivia Newton-John\n12:    Cars - Gary Numan\nARCHIVES: Love You Inside Out - The Bee Gees\n11:    Hurt So Bad - Linda Ronstadt\n10:    Biggest Part Of Me - Ambrosia\n9:    Another Brick In The Wall - Pink Floyd\n8:    Don't Fall In Love With A Dreamer - Kenny Rogers W/ Kim Carnes\n7:    You May Be Right - Billy Joel\n6:    Sexy Eyes - Dr. Hook\nLDD: We Are Family - Sister Sledge\n5:    With You I'm Born Again - Billy Preston &amp; Syreeta\n4:    Funky Town - Lipps, Inc.\n3:    Lost In Love - Air Supply\n2:    Ride Like The Wind - Christopher Cross\n1:    Call Me - Blondie\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ffcc8809cbd2bf849dd6ae4b86ac90595c82c073","amp;dn":"American_Top_40_1980_May_17th","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ffcc8809cbd2bf849dd6ae4b86ac90595c82c073","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,204,136,9,203,210,191,132,157,214,174,75,134,172,144,89,92,130,192,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
