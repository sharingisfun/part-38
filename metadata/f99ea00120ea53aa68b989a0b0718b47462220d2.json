Unfortunately, SkyNet does send another one back - and this one is called the T-X, even more powerful &amp; advanced than the dreaded T-1000. However, another CSM-101 Terminator is also sent back to protect John against the T-X. Now, Skynet is patiently assuming control of civilian computer systems, under the guise of a computer virus. John has also met his future wife, Kate Brewster, whose father - a U.S. Air Force General - is in charge of the military computer systems &amp; is leery of up linking SkyNet. However, when the SkyNet virus infects the U.S military computers &amp;leaves the country open to attack, the machines begin their horrific takeover. Soon a nuclear war will result - and the war against the machines will begin. Can the outdated CSM-101 Terminator eliminate the highly advanced T-X - or will a darker future await .\n\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/827Jaqa&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/827Jaqa&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/A4l9Pyg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/A4l9Pyg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/fqpjxHE&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/fqpjxHE&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/X7oEO1D&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/X7oEO1D&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/GZcHfck&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/GZcHfck&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/Eqx5kJ4&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/Eqx5kJ4&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/08a6oqg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/08a6oqg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/MXKAVZ5&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/MXKAVZ5&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/zQy6FBD&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/zQy6FBD&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/LEOfUca&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/LEOfUca&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/5L5VK6S&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/5L5VK6S&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/ZmYCaz2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/ZmYCaz2&lt;/a&gt;\n \n\n\n\n\nCast\n\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger - The Terminator\nNick Stahl - John Connor\nClaire Danes - Kate Brewster\nKristanna Loken - T-X\nDavid Andrews - Robert Brewster\nMark Famiglietti - Scott Peterson\nEarl Boen - Dr Peter Silberman\nMoira Harris - Betsy\nChopper Bernet - Chief Engineer\nChristopher Lawford - Brewster's Aide\nCarolyn Hennesy - Rich Woman\nM.C.

Vajna) went bankrupt at the end of 1995, and its assets / ancillary rights auctioned off to other companies. In 1997, Kassar and Vajna managed to restart their venture under their C2 Pictures banner. Half of the Terminator franchise rights was also part of the auction and they managed buy back the rights at $8 million. The other half of the rights was owned by Gale Anne Hurd who sold her share at $7 million. \n\nGoofs\nAt the end of the scene where they are by trailer, when the camera is on the Terminator, the camera tilts down revealing an apple box underneath the table. \n\nQuotes\n[first lines]\nJohn Connor: [voiceover] The future has not been written.
