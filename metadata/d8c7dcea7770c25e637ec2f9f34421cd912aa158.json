Nawy\nProduct Description\nFor one-semester, junior/senior-level and graduate courses in Reinforced Concrete in the department of civil engineering.This cutting-edge text analyzes the design of reinforced concrete members through a unique and practical step-by-step trial and adjustment procedure. The narrative is supplemented with flow charts to guide students logically through the learning process. Ample photographs of instructional testing of concrete members decreases the need for actual laboratory testing. This illustrates the failure of various types of structural members as well as demonstrates how the designed member behaves at ultimate load.\nFrom the Publisher\nExtensively revised to reflect the new ACI 318 Building Code, this cutting-edge text analyzes the design of reinforced concrete members through a unique and practical step-by-step trial and adjustment procedure. Supplementing text material with flow charts to logically guide students through the learning process, the book decreases the necessity of actual laboratory testing by offering ample photographs of instructional testing of concrete members. This illustrates the failure of various types of structural members as well as demonstrates how the designed member behaves at ultimate load.\nProduct Details\nHardcover: 848 pages\nPublisher: Prentice Hall; 5 edition (June 5, 2002)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 9780130083944\nISBN-13: 978-0130083944\nASIN: 0130083941\n\n[poly-technic.blogspot]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d8c7dcea7770c25e637ec2f9f34421cd912aa158","amp;dn":"Reinforced+Concrete%3A+A+Fundamental+Approach+%285th+Edition%29+by+Edw","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d8c7dcea7770c25e637ec2f9f34421cd912aa158","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,199,220,234,119,112,194,94,99,126,194,249,243,68,33,205,145,42,161,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
