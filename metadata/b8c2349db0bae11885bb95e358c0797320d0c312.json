With The Late Great Planet Earth, thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a fair amount of Animals-era Pink Floyd and some Kings-X s t y l e arranging. The end result is a groove-centric tale of apocalyptic destruction that explores the more intricate sides of traditional rock.\n\nWhile opening track ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œOn the EveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is a great song in its own right, with the great dynamics between the bass and guitar, the one-two punch of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCrematoriumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSix Billion People DeadÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ are my two favorite tracks on The Late Great Planet Earth. The two tie together, with the former serving as a mellow introduction to the latter. The verses to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSix Billion People DeadÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ follows the seasick rhythm of The Book of Knots, with a more conventional (and memorable) chorus keeping the song grounded. Elsewhere youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll find the paranoid groove of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe MyopicÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (whose central riffs flows into ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œClosed Casket,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ but takes on a different vibe altogether), the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œUs and ThemÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ sound of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFall of MegiddoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and the albumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s final tracks, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œExit the Atomic AgeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSet the World FreeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (which is more of a coda to the prior 11 songs).\n\nSo obviously thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a ton to like with The Late Great Planet Earth. From seemingly out of nowhere, hereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s another outstanding album. Mos Generator is definitely a band to watch out for, and this oneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s definitely on the recommended list.\n\nTracklist:\n\n1. On the Eve\n2. Crematorium\n3. Six Billion People Dead\n4.
