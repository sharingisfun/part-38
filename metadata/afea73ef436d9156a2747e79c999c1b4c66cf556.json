We take a look at what this would mean for the American people. Ron Paul is the republican front runner to win the Iowa Caucus on January 3rd, 2012.\n\nNOTE: Tarpley has a long-standing dislike for the Austrian School of economic thought in general, and for Ron Paul in particular, so he basically went into his analysis of Paul\\'s plan with his mind already made up.\n\n\n\n\n================================================\n\n\\&quot;Guns &amp; Butter\\&quot; investigates the relationships among capitalism, militarism and politics. Maintaining a radical perspective in the aftermath of the September 11th attacks, \\&quot;Guns &amp; Butter: The Economics of Politics\\&quot; reports on who wins and who loses when the economic resources of civil society are diverted toward global corporatization, war, and the furtherance of a national security state. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.kpfa.org/guns-and-butter&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.kpfa.org/guns-and-butter&lt;/a&gt;\n\n================================================\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent\\'s description, so I have included \nthe blog\\'s web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n  \n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually\n essential to seek information from a variety of sources, \n to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better \n understand the \\&quot;big picture.\\&quot; A reliance solely upon\n mainstream corporate media for news and info is a \n prescription for ignorance.
