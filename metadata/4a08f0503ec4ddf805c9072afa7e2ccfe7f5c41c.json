The music is performed by Steve Vai, Ry Cooder, Sonny Terry, Bill Kanengiser, Terry Evans, Amy Madigan, and John &quot;Juke&quot; Logan. See IMDB for proper titles and full credits.\n\nI recorded them from a HiFi VHS tape and encoded them with MP3 Producer Pro at 256kbps, 44kHz, stereo. The audio quality is good. The highs are crisp and the lows rumble, but there's a bit of background noise. These are rips from the film, so there's some dialogue and sound effects.\n\nEnjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4a08f0503ec4ddf805c9072afa7e2ccfe7f5c41c","amp;dn":"Crossroads+%28Steve+Vai%2C+Ry+Cooder%2C+blues+guitar%2C+unofficial+sound","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4a08f0503ec4ddf805c9072afa7e2ccfe7f5c41c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,8,240,80,62,196,221,248,5,201,7,42,250,126,44,207,231,245,196,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
