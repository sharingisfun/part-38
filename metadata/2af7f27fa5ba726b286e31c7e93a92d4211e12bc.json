ÃƒÅ“lo Pikkov wittily casts an anarchic eye on otherwise everyday occurrences in a quick-fire series of visual gags. The Associate Professor in the Animation Department at the Estonian Academy of the Arts must be a gas in the lecture room. The figures are drawn directly on to print film, resulting in a roughly hewn style that is entirely appropriate for a film that lambasts modern life.\n Ian Lumsden\n\n\n\nMe encanta entremezclar nombres, buscar relaciones, diÃƒÂ¡logos entre autores. AsÃƒÂ­ puedo decir que tal cosa es una mezcla de A, Zeta y B2. Suelen mirarme con cara de sos un pelotudo, pero me importa un carajo, sigo viendo la relaciÃƒÂ³n.\nAcÃƒÂ¡ no es solo que encuentro la locura de Maximov, la forma de hacer humor extremo de Plympton, el trazo de Driessen, sino que estaba seguro encontrar al final (tras el primer minuto no pude dejar de pensar en ÃƒÂ©l) un agradecimiento a Max Cachimba. Pero no.\n\n\nÃƒÅ“lo (b. 1976) studied animation at Turku Arts Academy in Finland and since 1996 has directed several award-winning short animation films in Eesti Joonisfilm and Nukufilm studios. His articles, caricatures and illustrations have been published in the Estonian press. In 2005 he graduated from the Institute of Law in University of Tartu, focusing on the media and authorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rights. Since then, he has worked as a manager and producer for documentary and animation films in Silmviburlane. \n\nIn parallel with producerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s work ÃƒÅ“lo has continued directing his own animation films and supporting new talents in the Estonian animation scene. Together with Priit PÃƒÂ¤rn he is the founder and associate professor of the Animation Department in the Estonian Academy of Arts. Recently he started PhD studies in Art and Design at the same institution. He is the author of Animasophy. Theoretical Writings on the Animated Film (2010).\n\nFor several years ÃƒÅ“lo was also the legal expert for the Estonian Film Foundation and chairman of Audiovisual Arts board at the Estonian Cultural Endowment. His secret passion is writing and illustrating children books. \n\nVideo:\n640 x 360\nH.264/MPEG-4 AVC\n758bks\nAudio:\nmp4a: MPEG-4 AAC LC\n44100Hz  110 kb/s tot , stereo (2/0) \n\nSilent movie, no subtitle need","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2af7f27fa5ba726b286e31c7e93a92d4211e12bc","amp;dn":"Dialogos+%28%26Uuml%3Blo+Pikkov%2C+Animation%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2af7f27fa5ba726b286e31c7e93a92d4211e12bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,247,242,127,165,186,114,107,40,110,49,199,233,58,146,212,33,30,18,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
