Her soulful, unique singing voice and her ability to boldly turn any material that she confronted into her own music made her a superstar of her time. Today, Holiday is remembered for her masterpieces, creativity and vivacity, as many of Holiday's songs are as well known today as they were decades ago. Holiday's poignant voice is still considered to be one of the greatest jazz voices of all time.\n\nNote: I added the cd scan to the artwork, but the cd is quite scratched; an close encounter with my son when he was 3 years, he played with it for a couple of hours :o\n\nBrought to you by TQMP.
