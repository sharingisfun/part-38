Does a particular nook or corner in our brains keep our treasured past safe so we can retrieve pieces of it when needed, the way we recover something from a basement room or a dusty attic? Well, not exactly. The brain simply does not have room to store everything we encounter in life. Instead memories get broken up into bits and pieces and, according to a peculiar housekeeping system, are dispersed among the rooms, closets and hallways of the brain. How we get the pieces to fit back together to produce memory is one of the brain's greatest mysteries.\n\n\nSeries Information\n\nComplex and deeply mysterious, the human brain is an odyssey unto itself. Take this journey into the inner workings of the mind with the guidance of scientist Dr. David Suzuki, the host of this riveting Discovery Channel documentary. This series explores the way the brain evolves from birth to adulthood; how memory works; how humans recover from brain injury; and the origins of creativity and identity.\n\n\nNarrated by David Suzuki\nWritten &amp; Directed by Masakatsu Takao &amp; Shunya Hirano\nEdited by Nobuto Sawamura &amp; Josh Berkley\nMusic by Joe Hisaishi\n\n\nAll credits go to PolarBear for creating and uploading.\n\n\nTO BE CONTINUED... \nSEE EPISODE 1 AMONG MY POSTS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:893a65fb37d5c65fbebb4e523728e94afc352154","amp;dn":"The+Brain%3A+Our+Universe+Within%3B+Ep.+2+-+Memory+%28Discovery%2C+1994%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"893a65fb37d5c65fbebb4e523728e94afc352154","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,58,101,251,55,213,198,95,190,187,78,82,55,40,233,74,252,53,33,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
