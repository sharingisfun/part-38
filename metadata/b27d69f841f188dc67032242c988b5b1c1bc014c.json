He relocates Flint, his friends, and the citizens of Swallow Falls to San Francisco. Unbeknownst to Flint, the FLDSMDFR survived the explosion and landed in the center of the island, and Chester is determined to find it. Chester invites Flint, his biggest fan, to work at Live Corp, where he meets Chester's assistant Barb, a talking orangutan with a human brain. Six months later, Flint humiliates himself during a promotion ceremony when his invention &quot;Party-In-A-Box&quot; explodes. Meanwhile, Chester is informed that his search-parties on the island have been attacked by monstrous cheeseburgers which are learning how to swim. Fearing the world's inevitable doom, Chester tasks Flint to find the FLDSMDFR and destroy it once and for all. Despite Chester's demands to keep the mission classified, Flint recruits his girlfriend and meteorologist Sam Sparks, her cameraman Manny, police officer Earl Devereaux, and &quot;Chicken&quot; Brent. Much to Flint's dismay, his father Tim joins the crew and they travel to Swallow Falls on his fishing boat.\n\n\n\n* enjoy ...\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b27d69f841f188dc67032242c988b5b1c1bc014c","amp;dn":"Cloudy+With+A+Chance+Of+Meatballs+2+TSCamRip.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b27d69f841f188dc67032242c988b5b1c1bc014c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,125,105,248,65,241,136,220,103,3,34,66,201,136,181,177,193,188,1,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
