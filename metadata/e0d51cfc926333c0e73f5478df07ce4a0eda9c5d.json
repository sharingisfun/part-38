After that &quot;The Search\nContinues&quot; (2011) and then &quot;Mala In\nCuba&quot; (2012). Now we have &quot;Havana\nCultura Mix - The Soundclash&quot;, a\ncompilation of collaborations between\nCuban vocalists/musicians and unsigned\nartists from all over the world.\nAll projects have brought musical\nexchanges to Cuba with its illustrious\nyet traditional music scene a nation\nwhere rhythms (salsa, rumba) exist as\nthe lifeblood of its people; where\naccess to new music is limited, barely\nany broadband internet service and\ndecent home studio technology is rarely\naffordable. Despite this, Havana boasts\na solid homegrown hip-hop scene and\nvibrant nightlife ruled by reggaeton,\nwith house, techno, EDM, dubstep, trap\nand moombahton breaking through.\nBesides, cultural exchanges are the\nessence of electronic music. Cuban\nrhythms (especially Afro-Cubano) trace\nback to the heart of dance music ÃƒÂ¹ from\ndisco through to Chicago house and\nbeyond and cross-pollination is what\nkeeps it moving forward, so what's\nwrong with bringing electronic music to\na nation that in a way helped birth it?\nThis is what &quot;Havana Cultura Mix - The\nSoundclash&quot; is all about. After sifting\nthrough hundreds of entries to a remix\ncompetition, 10 artists from all over\nthe world (UK, Germany, Hungary,\nHolland, South Africa, Russia,\nSwitzerland, Chile and Cuba) were\nselected by Gilles and his Brownswood\nproduction partner Simbad to travel to\nCuba to work in the studio with hand-\npicked singers, rappers,\npercussionists, brass and key players\nto put together an album.\nThe result is 12 tracks that not only\nshine a spotlight on electronic artists\nto watch, but showcase untouched talent\nwithin a tropical, vibrant place such\nas Cuba; a rare window into a charming\ncountry with a slow economy\ncharacterised by rum, vintage cars and\ncigars.\nIn combining these two worlds ÃƒÂ¹ the\npreservation of Cuba and the innovative\nrealm of electronic music Gilles,\nHavana Cultura and their artists not\nonly twist traditional forms to create\nsomething new, they give musical\nevolution a little nudge forward in the\nprocess.\n\npsst, more info at brownswoodrecordings.com\n\n01     Kerkstra Featuring Sexto Sentido - Eleggua           05:10\n02     Rukaiya Russell Featuring Sexto Sentido - Para Ti    05:09\n03     Kike Wolf - La Vida No Vale Nada                     05:04\n04     Raumskaya Featuring Dayme Arocena - U Knew Before    04:10\n05     Chillum Trio Featuring Coki &amp; Yeni - Yemaya          04:35\n06     Noi5er Featuring Dayme Arocena - Me Lleva La Habana  05:50\n07     Seu Seppie Featuring El Niche - Traigo               03:12\n08     Rukaiya Russell Featuring Los Niches And Charly      04:17\n       Mucha Rima - Ritmo Sensorial\n09     Teipah Featuring El B - Manana                       04:24\n10     Kerkstra Featuring Etian Brebaje &amp; Sexto Sentido -   03:40\n       Soy Cubano\n11     Merlin Cornu Featuring Dayme Arocena - Sandunga      04:15\n12     Dj Monokey Featuring Barbaro - Volar En Lo Profundo  03:08","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e0d51cfc926333c0e73f5478df07ce4a0eda9c5d","amp;dn":"VA-Havana_Cultura_Mix-The_Soundclash-%28BWOOD0130CD%29-CD-2014-jAZzM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e0d51cfc926333c0e73f5478df07ce4a0eda9c5d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,213,28,252,146,99,51,192,231,63,84,120,223,7,206,74,14,218,156,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
