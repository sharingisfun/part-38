The quest can be played in four difficulty levels, trying all the different vintage mods inspired by the arcade gaming era.\n\nThis game is our love letter to early 90Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ shoot Ã¢â‚¬Ëœem ups for Amiga and PC.\nWe wanted to bring back the challenge and the beauty of old the school classics we loved as kids and mix them with some modern tricks to create a new experience.\n\nAt Studio Evil we were avid gamers before becoming game developers. Syder Arcade is our first commercial game and we wanted to create a title that we would love to play in the first place.\nA real challenge for the player, and a feast for the eyes.\nWe wanted to start from the very roots of gaming, and we started with shoot emÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ ups.\nWe carefully examined both old school classics and modern bullet hell games trying to find a mixed formula that could bring back that old school vibe, and at the same time bring some new style of challenge.\n\nWaste no more time Player One, chose your Starfighter and prepare to smash your keyboard!\n\n[b]Features:[/b]\n\n- Stunning 3D realtime graphics\n- 6 ultra challenging campaing levels\n- 1 survival mode level\n- 3 different starships with different weapons\n- Online High Scores\n- 4 Difficulty levels, from easy to impossible!\n- Huge capital ships!\n- 20 different retro graphic flavours.
