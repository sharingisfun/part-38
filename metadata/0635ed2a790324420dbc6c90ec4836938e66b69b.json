High-speed, melodic and with an energetic rolling bassline at its core, &quot;Interstate&quot; is a track you can't go wrong with: be it a radio mix, a live set in a packed club or - who knows - maybe even a big open air, this collab is made for peaktime moments of any uplifting set. A big remix package is a worthy addition to the stunning original - 4 artists provide their interpretations of &quot;Interstate&quot; on this EP.\n First off is Alekzander with his trippy, techy approach which brings the BPM number down to allow for full treatment of the original artists' ideas with his trademark tech-trance sound.\n Witness45, on the other hand, follows the uplifting trance route laid by Alpha Duo and Light &amp; Wave, but puts slightly less focus on the melodic synths galore in favor of driving, entrancing beat.\n Iversoon &amp; Alex Daf provided a more traditional tech trance approach than Alekzander, while at the same time pulling off a surprising breakbeat trick in the breakdown, followed by an energetic and melodic climax.\n Finally, Alex Blest, a newcomer to the label, shows what his definition of uplifting trance is - with a deeper beat and piano lines, this version is a classy tribute to the days of classic trance.\n All in all, &quot;Interstate&quot; is a huge package - don't miss out on it!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0635ed2a790324420dbc6c90ec4836938e66b69b","amp;dn":"Alpha+Duo+and+Light+%26amp%3B+Wave+-+Interstate+%282013%29+Single+%40+320K","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0635ed2a790324420dbc6c90ec4836938e66b69b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,53,237,42,121,3,36,66,13,188,108,144,236,72,54,147,142,102,182,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
