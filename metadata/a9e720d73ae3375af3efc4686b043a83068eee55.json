MOTHER TERESA, FRANCIS OF ASSISI, JOHN PAUL II, THERESE OF LISIEUX, and IGNATIUS OF LOYOLA ALL HAVE IN COMMON?\n\nTHEY ALL PRACTICED THE FOUR SIGNS\n\nMatthew Kelly has a once-in-a-generation ability to bring the genius of Catholicism to life for the average person. The Four Signs of a Dynamic Catholic is brilliantly simple and practical. Every Catholic in America should read this book! -Allen Hunt, author of Confessions of a Mega Church Pastor\n\nAs human beings we are constantly engaging and disengaging in everything we do. We engage and disengage at work, in marriage, as parents, in our quest for health and well-being, in personal finances, environmentally, politically, and, of course, we engage or disengage spiritually.\n\nIf you walk into any Catholic church next Sunday and look around, you will discover that some people are highly engaged, others are massively disengaged, and the majority are somewhere in between. Why? What is the difference between highly engaged Catholics and disengaged Catholics?\n\nAnswering this question is essential to the future of the Catholic Church. If we truly want to engage Catholics and reinvigorate parish life, we must first discover what drives engagement among Catholics. Matthew Kelly explores this question in his groundbreaking new book, and the simplicity of what he discovers will amaze you.\n\nFour things make the difference between highly engaged Catholics and disengaged Catholics: the four signs of a Dynamic Catholic.\n\nWhether you are ready to let God take your spiritual life to the next level or want to help reinvigorate your parish, The Four Signs of a Dynamic Catholic promises to take you on a journey that will help you live out the genius of Catholicism in your everyday life.\n\nThe central idea in this book should change the way we live our faith and the way we teach our faith. This book is a game changer.\n\n--About the Author--\n\nMatthew Kelly is a New York Times best-selling author of sixteen books, an internationally acclaimed speaker, and a business consultant to some of the world s largest and most admired companies.

Born in Sydney, Australia, he began speaking and writing in his late teens while he was attending business school. Since that time, more than four million people have attended his seminars and presentations in more than fifty countries.

Raised Catholic, Kelly discovered what he calls the genius of Catholicism in his teens and has spent the past two decades inspiring millions of men, woman, and children to explore the faith in a fresh way.
