Tintin, Snowy and Captain Haddock have a kidnapping on their hands. Professor Calculus has vanished. His disappearance is certainly connected with an ancient curse of the Incas, and the trail leads to Peru. But everyone fears the vengeance of the Prince of the Sun and only Zorrino, the young orange-seller, will help them. High into the Andes they go, but the perilous journey ends in a dungeon and the prisoners face a hideous end. \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/9d/Tintin_cover_-_Prisoners_of_the_Sun.JPG&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/9d/Tintin_cover_-_Prisoners_of_the_Sun.JPG&lt;/a&gt;\n\nenjoi,\n\nsani\n\n\nWhen I was a kid the cover of this story scared the crap out of me!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:127b0bcea956dc5d99e2c52a7f3b309dd4213123","amp;dn":"The+Adventures+of+Tintin+-+The+Temple+of+the+Sun","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"127b0bcea956dc5d99e2c52a7f3b309dd4213123","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,123,11,206,169,86,220,93,153,226,197,42,127,59,48,157,212,33,49,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
