East St. Louis Blues\n\n\nThe first of three Document CDs that reissue all of pianist Jimmy Yancey's recordings (other than his final Atlantic session) is filled with classic performances. Yancey, a subtle boogie-woogie/blues pianist who was a major influence and inspiration on the better-known players of the 1930s, is featured on his first two solo sessions, including &quot;The Fives,&quot; &quot;La Salle Street Breakdown,&quot; &quot;South Side Stuff,&quot; &quot;Yancey's Getaway,&quot; &quot;Yancey Stomp,&quot; and &quot;State Street Special.&quot; Highly recommended as are the two following volumes in this valuable Document series.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Album: Jimmy Yancey Vol. 2 1940 - 1943 \nBitrate: 320K/s \nTime: 64:47 \nSize: 148.3 MB \nLabel: Document\nStyles: Boogie woogie, Piano blues, Acoustic Chicago blues\nYear: 1991 \nArt: Front \n\n[2:48] 1.

Jimmy's Rocks\n[4:29] 19. How Long Blues\n\n\nOn the second of three CDs that trace virtually his entire recording career, pianist Jimmy Yancey is showcased on a variety of solo tracks. Two numbers from February 1940 are highlighted by the classic &quot;Bear Trap Blues.&quot; There are a couple of numbers made for the tiny Art Center Jazz Gems label, a four-song (plus two alternate takes) definitive set cut for Bluebird (which includes &quot;Death Letter Blues&quot; and &quot;Yancey's Bugle Call&quot;), and nine songs (five previously unissued) from 1943; on one version of &quot;How Long Blues,&quot; Mama Yancey sings while Jimmy switches to the spooky-sounding harmonium. This set also has Jimmy Yancey's only four recorded vocals, which are quite effective even though his voice is limited. All three volumes in this series are highly recommended collections of music by this subtle pianist, who made expert use of space and ended every tune in E flat.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Album: Jimmy Yancey Vol.3 (1943-1950) \nBitrate: 320K/s \nTime: 69:30 \nSize: 162.4 MB \nLabel: Document\nStyles: Boogie woogie, Piano blues, Acoustic Chicago blues\nYear: 1991 \nArt: Front \n\n[4:11] 1.

Ecstatic Rag\n\n\nThe third of three CDs tracing the recording career of the unique boogie-woogie pianist Jimmy Yancey, whose subtlety could often result in some dramatic music, completes his December 1943 session and also has his December 23, 1950 solo set; his final recordings from July 1951 are available on an Atlantic release. The 1943 titles, three of which were previously unreleased, include two with Mama Yancey's vocals (Jimmy switches to harmonium on one) and are highlighted by &quot;White Sox Stomp,&quot; &quot;Yancey Special,&quot; and two versions of &quot;Make Me a Pallet on the Floor.&quot; After the six fine titles from 1950, this CD finishes off with the only four numbers that Jimmy's older brother, the more ragtime-oriented Alonzo Yancey, ever recorded. Although his style was different, on &quot;Ecstatic Rag&quot; Alonzo does sound a bit like Jimmy. All three of these Document CDs, plus the Atlantic set, are highly recommended and preferable to the piecemeal domestic Bluebird reissues. \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:83e0f6e76a8b2ee36f310e9c25d395d3fb1f8afa","amp;dn":"%28Piano+Blues%29+Jimmy+Yancey+-+Complete+Recordings+%281939-1950%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"83e0f6e76a8b2ee36f310e9c25d395d3fb1f8afa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,224,246,231,106,139,46,227,111,49,14,156,37,211,149,211,251,31,138,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
