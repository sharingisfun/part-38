Their goal is to accumulate as much finances as they can to unlock the next vehicle or level, each different from the other. Race to the finish, but keep the cargo safe at the same time.\n\n\nThe game features:\n\n\n-Physics based game, making it very fun\n-Currently 5 different vehicles: bike, pickup, 4x4 pickup, truck and a huge truck to transport the cargo.\n-A trailer can be attached to all the vehicles, once unlocked\n-Some upgrades (limited for now, more in future versions)\n-6 different levels (more to come soon)\n-There are two pedals, one for gas and one for braking / reverse.\n-Various cargo, each with different characteristics and physics\n-Custom drawn game graphics.\n\nIf you have any problems, suggestions or questions about the game please, contact me at: &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;2b5e584e4d5e47054a5b5b586b524a43444405484446&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n\nPlease, nclude detailed description of the problem, so I can fix it.\n\nI hope you enjoy my game :) .
