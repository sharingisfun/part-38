It will work for every airport as long as the standard ATC of FSX is able to assign a taxiroute to you. \n\nIf ATC tells you to &amp;#039;Taxi to Gate X&amp;#039; without specifying a route (via taxiway ...) then unfortunately FollowMe is not able to guide you. \n\nTaking off\nUpon confirming the route to the runway ATC assigns you, you can request a &amp;#039;Follow me car&amp;#039; that will guide you to the runway. \n\nLanding\nAfter you land and clear the runway ATC from the Tower will hand you off to Ground, where you can request a taxi route. After confirming the route you can request a &amp;#039;Follow me car&amp;#039;. The car will guide you along the assigned route to your gate.\n\nCompatibility \n* FollowMe is compatible with all default airports in FSX.\n* FollowMe has not been tested with add-on airports but should be compatible with all airports that have proper taxiways defined.\n* FollowMe will not work with ATC add-ons that do not use the FSX assigned taxiroutes.\n* FollowMe will not work in online modes where a human controller assigns you a taxiroute.\n* FollowMe will only work for the user&amp;#039;s plane.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3fe5560035421d6d842841e52950bdb82f85d0f8","amp;dn":"FSX+-+Daniel+van+Os+-+FollowMe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3fe5560035421d6d842841e52950bdb82f85d0f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,229,86,0,53,66,29,109,132,40,65,229,41,80,189,184,47,133,208,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
