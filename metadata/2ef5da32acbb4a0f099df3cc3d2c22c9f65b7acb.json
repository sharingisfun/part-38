To drill down to a folder, just click on a segment. To bubble up, click in the center. Move the mouse over the diagram and see the name and path of each file, and enclosed files (if any). Hit Space to quickly preview file content, without launching another application. Ctrl-click to open a file in Finder.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ef5da32acbb4a0f099df3cc3d2c22c9f65b7acb","amp;dn":"DaisyDisk+1.0.1%2BPatch.dmg","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ef5da32acbb4a0f099df3cc3d2c22c9f65b7acb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,245,218,50,172,187,74,15,9,157,243,204,61,44,34,201,246,91,122,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
