You bet. Is it somewhat formula country? Probably. But do the songs sound great when Randy sings them and despite their melodrama do they tug at your heart a little and lift your soul--absolutely! Whether he's being serious as in When Mama Prayed; inspirtational as in Raise Him Up; or funny as in Pray for the Fish--you'll find Randy's take on a gospel album successful because the songs are perfect for his voice and style. \n\nUnlike many secular artists who make spiritual albums, Randy's sacred music reflects his well-known strengths as a musician while still being theologically sound. You can truly use this CD as part of your personal worship.\n\nThe production on this CD is great. They use minimal and simple instruments and keep Randy's voice at the forefront. In my opinion, it's one of his best albums, including his secular music.\n\n\n\nTORRENTED BY:\n\nTorrent Tracts, May 2009\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2e6bf26626a9e683dfc4d5147193a96ec55a1e2","amp;dn":"Randy+Travis+-+2004+-+Rise+And+Shine","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a2e6bf26626a9e683dfc4d5147193a96ec55a1e2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,230,191,38,98,106,158,104,61,252,77,81,71,25,58,150,236,85,161,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
