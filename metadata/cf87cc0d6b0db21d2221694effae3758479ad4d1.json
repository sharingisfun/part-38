If you like it, and want to support the campaign, you can choose to buy it. Each version you buy will count as a sale towards the charts.\n\nIf you want to buy it, all the links are available here: http://itsdanbull.com/single\n\nThere are ten versions in all, meaning a single person can create ten sales towards the charts.\n\nThe singles charts are worthless as an indicator of quality, and artists needn't strive for the validation of reaching them.\n\nHowever, by taking a free song by an unsigned artist to the echelons normally reserved for the industry elite, I want to smash the glass ceiling and show that there is another way of doing things.\n\nWe don't need the protection of ACTA, CISPA or any other acronym. As long as our internet is free, creativity will thrive.\n\nLove,\nDan x\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf87cc0d6b0db21d2221694effae3758479ad4d1","amp;dn":"Dan+Bull+-+Sharing+Is+Caring+%2B+bonus+tracks","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf87cc0d6b0db21d2221694effae3758479ad4d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,135,204,13,107,13,178,29,34,33,105,78,255,174,55,88,71,154,212,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
