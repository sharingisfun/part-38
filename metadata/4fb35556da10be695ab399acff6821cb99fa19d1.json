Their exploits lead them to a relative's home in Utah and eventually a thrilling confrontation with their past and the merger of time. It is based partly on Book of Mormon people, including the Zarahemla of the title.\nOverview\nKerra (Sakerra) and Brock McConnell are orphans on the run. To keep from being separated by state authorities, Kerra flees to the only relative she remembers from her earliest childhood ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ a Latter Day Saint aunt and uncle who live near a wondrous place in the woods where parallel realities collide and where an ancient people called Nephites cross paths with the residents of a sleepy Utah town.\nPlot\nThe story begins with its focus on a group of hunters illegally hunting game out in the woods. Originally thought to be dead, the hunter's target springs back to life and flees into the heavy brush and trees. Determined not to let the game suffer, one of the hunters decides to pursue the elk in its fleet. After some amount of exploration he finds his elk...hanging over a branch, shot by an arrow. Hearing noises he turns around to an arrow shot at him and screams.\nKerra and Brock are introduced to the story line at their mother's funeral. With their father having apparently disappeared for some unknown reason years ago, their mother recently dying, and no other known relatives within the area, the two are set to become wards of the state. In an effort to keep the two together, Kerra decides that they must pack up their belongings and escape before the return of the social worker assigned to their case. Brock, having prior association with a local gang and a criminal record, assists his sister in stealing the social worker's vehicle. The two drive off in a fury in an effort to escape.\nRemembering a relative from early on in her childhood, Kerra plots a course for Leeds, Utah, a small LDS rich community in the southern part of the state. Arriving at their aunt and uncle's house, the two concoct a story indicating that they are traveling across the country to meet up with their mother who had recently acquired a new place of employment. With the stolen car having problems, the pair is unable to travel any further until it is fixed, and are offered a place to stay until repairs are completed.\nShortly after their arrival, Kerra is confronted by her cousins with stories from her early childhood days. These stories recall &quot;strange noises&quot; in the woods behind their house and dealings with an &quot;imaginary&quot; being whom Kerra had termed to be &quot;Kid Donni.&quot; One night after the siblings arrival, an earthquake shakes the area with the epicenter believed to be near the property of their Aunt Corrine and Uncle Drew.\nFollowing the quake, Kerra is reunited with her &quot;imaginary&quot; childhood friend Kiddoni, who is in reality a noted being from the Book of Mormon. The earthquake is revealed to have caused a &quot;rift&quot; in time - allowing Kerra contact with the ancient Nephite peoples and their adversaries, and allowing Kiddoni and his people to cross the time gap into the modern world.\nAs the story progresses, the time portal gap expands and eventually allows the Nephite and Gadianton armiesto exit the past near the Whitman's home. Brock on the other hand is unaware of this time rift and eventually finds himself captured by the Gadianton armies. It is at this time that he comes into contact with a scraggly-bearded individual from &quot;modern&quot; times named Chris.\nMeanwhile, during their escape from California, Brock had been given a bag by a former gang-member to take out of the area, which is later revealed to be a bag full of illegal drugs. Upon realizing who was in possession of the bag, the gang leader decides to make a trip to the small Utah community to recover the bag.\nNear the end of the story the two worlds clash as the rift in time grows very large. The Gadianton army crosses the time border into the present day in an effort to find food for their armies. Through sheer coincidence Chris and Brock reunite with Kerra near the Whitman home, where it is revealed that Chris is the siblings father, who had disappeared during a hunting trip many years earlier. A major Nephite-Gadianton battle eventually ensues near the Whitman home while the trio of family retreats into hiding. Shortly thereafter, another quake hits the area and the division between the time periods is restored. Kerra is heartbroken at not getting to say goodbye to her Nephite friend, but both families are happy that they were kept safe and that father and children were reunited again.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHistoria\nKerra y brock McConnell son hermanos huÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©rfanos y fugitivos.\nPara evitar ser separados por las autoridades estatales, huyen buscando ayuda dirigiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©ndose a la casa de los ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âºnicos parientes de los cuales Kerra conserva recuerdos de su niÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±ez: unos tÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­os, miembros de la Iglesia de Jesucristo de los Santos de los ÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¡ltimos DÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­as (Mormones), que viven en Leeds, un pueblito de Utah al borde de un asombroso lugar en el bosque donde estÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡ a punto de revelarse un grande misterio.\nSe enfrentan dos realidades paralelas; y donde un antiguo pueblo, el de los Nefitas, se cruza en su camino con las residentes de una tranquila localidad en Utah.\nEmbÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡rcate en una aventura en la que el suspenso te dejarÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡ sin aliento y vive una historia de amor que sobrepasa el lÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­mite del tiempo y el espacio en un mundo lleno de extraordinaria imaginaciÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³n.\nDescubre junto con Kerra y su hermano menor, misterios en el bosque cercano donde se encuentra un pasaje secreto hacia el mundo de selvas tropicales del Libro de MormÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³n en el aÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±o 19 AD y donde se encuentran cara a cara con un Nefita y ladrones de GadiantÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³n.\n\n===========================================================================\n\nFile Format\n-----------\n\nAudio Language: English\nSubtitles: Spanish\n\nDuration: 105 Minutes\nType: DVD\nFile Extension: .iso (Burn in a DVD or Mount on Virtual Drive)\n\nVideo\nCodec: MPEG-1/2\nResolution: 720 x 480\nFrame Rate: 60 FPS\nFormat: 16:9 Widescreen\nAspect Ratio: 1.85 : 1\n\nAudio:\nCodec: Dolby Digital AC3\nChannels: 2 (Stereo) + AC3\nSample rate: 48000 Hz\nBitrate: 192 kb/s\n\n===========================================================================\n\nOther Movies in Varius Languages and Versions - Otras PelÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­culas en Varias Versiones e Idiomas\n---------------------------------------------\n\nThe Testaments of one Fold and one Shepherd\nMultilanguage Full DVD Version (English Audio Not Included)/ VersiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³n DVD Multidioma\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5655571\n\nThe Testaments of one Fold and one Shepherd\nEnglish Audio Version / VersiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³n con Audio en Ingles\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5650100\n\nThe Testaments of one Fold and one Shepherd\nSpanish Audio Version / VersiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³n con Audio en EspaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±ol\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5654010\n\n---------------------------------------------\n\nThe Work and the Glory - Full Trilogy\nEnglish Audio Version / VersiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³n con Audio en Ingles\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5663012\n\n---------------------------------------------\n\nO Outro Lado do Ceu\nPortuguese Audio\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5676680\n\n---------------------------------------------\n\nPassage to Zarahemla Movie DVD (English Ingles - EspaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±ol Spanish)\nMultilanguage Full DVD Version English Audio - Spanish Optinal Subtitles/ VersiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³n DVD Multidioma\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5662897","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4fb35556da10be695ab399acff6821cb99fa19d1","amp;dn":"PASSAGE+TO+ZARAHEMLA++-+PASAJE+A+ZARAHEMLA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4fb35556da10be695ab399acff6821cb99fa19d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,179,85,86,218,16,190,105,90,179,153,172,255,104,33,203,153,250,25,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
