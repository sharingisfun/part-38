Once again, enjoy the adventures of the Junior Rangers and their friends Joe Two Rivers, Chief Forest Ranger Keeley and RCMP Sergeant Scott.\n\nQuality is reasonable considering these shows are almost fifty years old. Episode 3 - The Wolf, is missing the front credits and a few seconds of the show itself, but is still more than watchable. \n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6eb01f595e426333351df91a96a4f148d7a7f721","amp;dn":"The+Forest+Rangers+++%28Season+3+-+Complete%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6eb01f595e426333351df91a96a4f148d7a7f721","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,176,31,89,94,66,99,51,53,29,249,26,150,164,241,72,215,167,247,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
