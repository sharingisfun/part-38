He's been called the &quot;voice of Generation Y&quot; and his writing and stand-up work have started to earn him critical praise -- and several significant paydays.\n\nNPR's Jesse Baker spoke to the New York-based comic about his work as a writer for NBC's Late Night with Conan O'Brien and his numerous side projects.\n\nA graduate of Yale, Martin dropped out of law school six years ago to take up comedy full time. Armed with only his acoustic guitar and a &quot;to do&quot; list of material, he began to test out his jokes on New York City club audiences.\n\nMartin now spends 60 hours a week writing for O'Brien and he's midway through a screenplay for comedy film guru Ivan Reitman of Animal House fame.\n\nThe comic is also working on a one-man show for this year's Edinburgh Fringe festival in Scotland. Last year he won the festival's prestigious Perrier Comedy Writing Award.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b565e2078528d4f3f3cb72b63ce0b1b2de17137","amp;dn":"Comedy+Central+Presents+Demetri+Martin.mpg","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b565e2078528d4f3f3cb72b63ce0b1b2de17137","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,86,94,32,120,82,141,79,63,60,183,43,99,206,11,27,45,225,113,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
