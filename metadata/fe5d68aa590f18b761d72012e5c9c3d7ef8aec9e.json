This thirty page report contains precise classified information regarding Sept. 11th 2001 and its related subsets. Absolutely nothing contained within this report is opinion, conjecture or theory. The entirety of this report, from beginning to end, is crammed with absolute facts regarding said date.\n\nInitially the density, spread and volume of information contained within may be overwhelming and may at first appear confusing. If concerns or questions arise take a deep breath and highlight or jot down the question with the understanding that it will be addressed at some point within the report. This is so because of how we had to compile and translate the data into sections or blocks that are understandable for this format. We are aware that this potentially makes the information more difficult to read and for this we apologize. Although unorthodox, we have chosen this specific method of first contact primarily to protect our identities.\n\nThe information within these pages has been assembled by several individuals of sufficient rank and position who have firsthand knowledge of Sept. 11th 2001 and/or access to the classified files regarding it. As will be explained later in this report, there are very serious and very urgent reasons why we have unanimously agreed to hastily forward this classified set of data in the public medium. The final page of this report is the most important and we suggest that it is seriously considered.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe5d68aa590f18b761d72012e5c9c3d7ef8aec9e","amp;dn":"Dakota+Report","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe5d68aa590f18b761d72012e5c9c3d7ef8aec9e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,93,104,170,89,15,24,183,97,215,32,18,229,201,195,215,239,138,236,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
