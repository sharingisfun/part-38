An odd little history ignored by almost everyone. Until the night of the big storm, and the crack in the fault line, and the release of something foul from the earth's guts, blown across the little town on Smoky Island. And the only two people on the island who were outside its reach are now trapped on a black spit of rock with a population who aren't people anymore. They started eating each other an hour ago.
