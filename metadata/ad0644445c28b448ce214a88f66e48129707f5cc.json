By then several fake versions had however already made their way to the public, including an edited version of the Philadelphia, PA 12.04.69 recording released on the bootleg Major Tom MT 014 &quot;Live in Honolulu&quot; (ftbfs: B576).\n- The Jimi Hendrix Experience performed three nights at the Waikiki Shell in Honolulu may-june 1969, and a high degree of uncertainty surrounds the exact date for this particular recording; The correct date might as well be 31.05.69 or 01.06.69 as the 30.05.69 date given here.\n- &quot;Hear My Train A-Comin'&quot; (62) is just 0:04 of the intro.\n- The Sound of this recording is very muddy, but it can be improved by using a graphic equalizer and rolling the bass end off at around 125 / 250 Hz and boosting the top end at 1 kHz and 2 kHz. Everything from 4 kHz and upwards is noise so it can be cut. (info: Jimpress issue 77, p.38)\n- Refer to Jimpress issue 77, p.38 and UniVibes issue 48, p. 19-20 comprehensive reviews of this tape.\n- EQ'd version is available.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad0644445c28b448ce214a88f66e48129707f5cc","amp;dn":"Jimi+Hendrix+05-30-69+-+Honolulu%2C+Waikiki+Shell+FLAC+covers+incl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ad0644445c28b448ce214a88f66e48129707f5cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,6,68,68,92,40,180,72,206,33,74,136,246,110,72,18,151,7,245,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
