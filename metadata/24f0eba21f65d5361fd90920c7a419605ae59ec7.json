While some of the new functionality may not appeal, the most significant changes are major improvements to what was already a very good piece of software. Strongly recommended.\n\nThere are a few utilities out there which can make your life so much easier, you wouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t contemplate living without them. As someone who works on the web, IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m taking screenshots all the time and SnagIt is the only tool IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d use for this vital element of my job.\n\nIn its latest incarnation, SnagIt has added a lot of new features and a jazzed-up interface. While the old familiar ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“big red buttonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ remains, much of the UI (particularly in the Editor window) has been completely overhauled. Gone is the XP blue of previous versions, replaced with a Vista-friendly charcoal look which works pretty well.\n\nThe programÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s key features (taking and editing screenshots) remain pretty much unchanged. You still have a huge amount of power of just what type of screenshot you can take, with timers, cursor settings and profiles all still playing a major role. I was pleased to see that my profiles from the last version of SnagIt were kept as it would have been a real nuisance to have to re-program them.\n\nThe biggest improvements to this new version are certainly connected to the Editor window. For example: whereas previously, you had to take a capture, work on it, save it and then take your next one; now you can take as many screenshots as you like, using whichever profiles, and work on them all as you wish. This is a huge time-saver and a very welcome addition to the program.\n\nAnother feature that has been added is of less obvious use. SnagIt now supports meta-tagging and labeling of captured images. The idea behind this feature is that you start to use SnagIt to categorize your images as well as capture them. I can understand the thinking behind this addition but IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m not sure if itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s really much more than feature-creep. I canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t see myself changing my workflow to fit with SnagIt, nor do I want to lose the capability of moving image files around at will (if you use Windows Explorer to move tagged images, the tags and labels are lost).\n\nCapture Features\n\n* Sequential capture\n* New Visual Design\n* Capture Web Pages with Links\n* Capture All File Types From the Web\n* Improved Desktop Integration\n* Banner and Domain Blocking Technology added to Web Capture\n* Enhanced Web Capture\n* Enhanced Auto Scroll Capture\n* Import and Export Capture Profiles\n* Capture profile interface\n* Capture profile wizard\n* SnagIt OneClick interface\n* Microsoft Outlook add-in\n* Microsoft Excel Add-In\n* 16 New File Formats\n* Adobe Framemaker Plug-in\n* Microsoft Word Add-In\n* Microsoft PowerPoint Add-In\n* Internet Explorer Add-In\n* COM Server Interface\n* Printer Capture\n* Extended Windows Capture\n* Web Capture\n* DirectX Capture\n* Layered Windows Capture\n* Multiple Region Capture\n* Delayed and Scheduled Capture\n* TWAIN support\n* Irregular Shape Capture\n* Horizontal Scrolling Windows\n* Object Capture\n* Digital Camera files: JPEG and TIFF\n* Audio Recording\n* Transparent GIF\n* Cascaded Menu Capture\n* BMP, GIF, JPEG, TIFF, PCX, PNG, interlaced GIF, progressive JPEG\n* Slow AVI Capture and Playback\n* Fixed Region Capture\n* Text Capture\n* Video Capture\n\nCompatible with: Windows 2000, XP (32-bit or 64-bit), Vista (32-bit or 64-bit)\nLanguage: English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:24f0eba21f65d5361fd90920c7a419605ae59ec7","amp;dn":"Techsmith.Snagit.v10.0.1.Build.58.Incl.serial","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"24f0eba21f65d5361fd90920c7a419605ae59ec7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,240,235,162,31,101,213,54,31,217,9,32,199,164,25,96,90,229,158,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
