Static Guard Stance is no longer required to parry enemy attacks.\n Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Geralt automatically parries enemy sword attacks and deflects incoming arrows. It doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t mean Geralt is invincible. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not a 100% chance to parry and the value is not constant. It changes depending on how many hits you block in a short time and from where does the hit land.\n Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Geralt and his attackers are no longer bouncing off parry. It allows to continue attack sequence.\n Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Monster attacks still cannot be parried with a sword.\n Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ While using Guard Stance Geralt channels an active Quen shield.\n Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Above listed changes to defence mechanics decreased importance of rolling in combat.\n\nPlus more changes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec6a645339c229118002314aae6789b3bb24da7a","amp;dn":"Witcher_2_mod_CombatRevamp2.zip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec6a645339c229118002314aae6789b3bb24da7a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,106,100,83,57,194,41,17,128,2,49,74,174,103,137,179,187,36,218,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
