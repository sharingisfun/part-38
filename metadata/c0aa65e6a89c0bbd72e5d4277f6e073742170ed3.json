Though the studio recordings from this golden period are impeccable, nowhere is the band's growth more evident than on GOT LIVE IF YOU WANT IT. Recorded by Glyn Johns at London's Royal Albert Hall, this album shows the Stones as a powerful live unit, now capable of subtle emotional shadings as well as rock &amp; roll raveups.\r\n\r\nThe Stones pay homage to their roots with versions of &quot;Not Fade Away&quot; and &quot;Satisfaction&quot; that easily rival their studio cousins. It's the point at which the Stones' musical trajectory veers off from the blues that things get really, interesting, though. From the ominous &quot;Under My Thumb&quot; to the Elizabethan &quot;Lady Jane&quot; and the transcendent, Dylan-influenced &quot;19th Nervous Breakdown,&quot; the band shows off its musical sophistication both compositionally and in spirited performances. An essential live document of one of the band's finest hours.\r\n\r\n\r\nRecorded live at the Royal Albert Hall, London, England on September 23, 1966.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTracklist:\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n01 - Under My Thumb\r\n02 - Get off of My Cloud\r\n03 - Lady Jane\r\n04 - Not Fade Away\r\n05 - I've Been Loving You Too Long\r\n06 - Fortune Teller\r\n07 - The Last Time\r\n08 - 19th Nervous Breakdown\r\n09 - Time Is on My Side\r\n10 - I'm Alright\r\n11 - Have You Seen Your Mother, Baby, Standing in the Shadows\r\n12 - (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\r\n\r\n*2006 ABKCO Records / Universal Music Japan | UICY-93022 {Japan Mini LP Remastered 2006, UICY-93022}\r\n\r\n\r\nPersonnel:\r\nMick Jagger (vocals)\r\nBrian Jones (guitar)\r\nKeith Richards (guitar, background vocals)\r\nBill Wyman (bass)\r\nCharlie Watts (drums).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMore Rolling Stones Japan Mini LP DSD Remaster 2006:\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Rolling Stones - 12x5 (1964) [EAC-FLAC]:\r\n      \nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10760623/The_Rolling_Stones_-_12x5_%281964%29__%5BEAC-FLAC%5D\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Rolling Stones - England's Newest Hit Makers (1964) [EAC-FLAC]:\r\n       \nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10751837/The_Rolling_Stones_-_England_s_Newest_Hit_Makers_%281964%29_%5BEAC-FLA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Rolling Stones - The Rolling Stones, Now!
