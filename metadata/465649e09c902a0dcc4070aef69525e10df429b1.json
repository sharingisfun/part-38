To reflect these developments, renowned author, educator, and researcher J.N. Reddy has thoroughly revised, updated, and enhanced his standard-setting Mechanics of Laminated Composite Plates and Shells: Theory and Analysis.New in the Second Edition:Ã¢â‚¬Â¢A new chapter dedicated to the theory and analysis of laminated shellsÃ¢â‚¬Â¢New discussions addressing smart structures and functionally graded materialsÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Thorough updates to all chapters and a reorganization of chapters that improves the clarity of the presentationÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Additional exercises and examples. No other book is as up to date. No other book approaches the subject primarily from the finite element method. And no other book provides such full, self-contained coverage of the theories, analytical solutions, and linear and nonlinear finite element models of plate and shell laminated composite structures","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:465649e09c902a0dcc4070aef69525e10df429b1","amp;dn":"J.+N.+Reddy+-+Mechanics+of+Laminated+Composite+Plates+and+Shells","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"465649e09c902a0dcc4070aef69525e10df429b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,86,73,224,156,144,42,13,204,64,112,174,246,149,37,225,13,244,41,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
