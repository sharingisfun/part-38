Released in February 1985, the album entered the UK album chart at no.2 and remained in the upper reaches of the chart for the next 12 months. Songs from the Big Chair became one of the year&amp;#039;s biggest global sellers and achieved quintuple-platinum sales status in the U.S. (where it remained the no.1 album for five weeks).\n\nThe album included the hit singles &quot;Mothers Talk&quot;, &quot;Shout&quot;, &quot;Everybody Wants to Rule the World&quot; and &quot;Head Over Heels&quot;. With this album, Roland Orzabal and Curt Smith lessened their preoccupation with pop psychology and turned their attention to wider themes, including the global politics of the Reagan-Thatcher era. They did away with the predominantly synth-pop feel of the first album, instead expanding into a more sophisticated sound that would become the band&amp;#039;s stylistic hallmark.\n\nSongs from the Big Chair was remastered and re-issued on CD in 1999 with bonus tracks, including b-sides and remixes. Three of the tracks (&quot;The Conflict&quot;, &quot;The Marauders&quot; and &quot;Broken Revisited&quot;) are actually from the The Hurting period. The album was re-released again in Deluxe Edition 2-disc format in 2006 with the full collection of b-sides and many alternate versions and remixes of the album&amp;#039;s tracks.\n\nTrack listing\n01 - Shout\n02 - The Working Hour\n03 - Everybody Wants To Rule The World\n04 - Mothers Talk\n05 - I Believe\n06 - Broken\n07 - Head Over Heels / Broken (Live)\n08 - Listen\n09 - The Big Chair\n10 - Empire Building\n11 - The Marauders\n12 - Broken Revisited\n13 - The Conflict\n14 - Mothers Talk (U.S. Remix)\n15 - Shout (U.S. Remix)\n\nAll tracks are DRM-free and encoded losslessly in FLAC format (16 bit, stereo, 44.1 kHz).
