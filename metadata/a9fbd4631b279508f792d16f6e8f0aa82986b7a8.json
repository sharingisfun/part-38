So he enlists the help of fellow bodybuilder Adrian Doorbal (Anthony Mackie) and ex-convict, Christian bodybuilder Paul Doyle (Dwayne Johnson). Their kidnapping and extortion scheme goes terribly wrong since they have muscles for brains and they're left to haphazardly try to hold onto the elusive American dream.\n\nHater7.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9fbd4631b279508f792d16f6e8f0aa82986b7a8","amp;dn":"Pain+and+Gain+%5BDVD%5D%5BISO%5D%5BDUAL+ING%2FSPA%5D%5BSUBS%5D+-+Hater7","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a9fbd4631b279508f792d16f6e8f0aa82986b7a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,251,212,99,27,39,149,8,247,146,209,111,110,143,10,168,41,134,183,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
