In the real world, there may be nothing special about him, but online, he's one of the world's top players of the combat game called Btooom. One day, he awakes on what appears to be a tropical island, though he has no memory of how he got there or why. While exploring the island, Ryota runs into a mysterious being who attacks him by throwing a strange looking bomb at him. Ryota then realizes that both his life is in danger, and that he has somehow become trapped in a real-life version of his favorite game. Ryota and the other &quot;players&quot; must now survive through the nightmare to figure out the reason why they ended up in the game in the first place.\n\nAlternative title:\nÃ£Æ’â€“Ã£Æ’Ë†Ã£â€šÂ¥Ã£Æ’Â¼Ã£Æ’Â  (Japanese)\nÃ©Â©Å¡Ã§Ë†â€ Ã©ï¿½Å Ã¦Ë†Â² (Chinese (Taiwan))\nGenres: action, fantasy, mystery, psychological, romance, science fiction\nThemes: fanservice, NEET, online computer gaming(, survival, survival game\nObjectionable content: Intense\n\nRunning time: 24 minutes per episode\nNumber of episodes: 12\nVintage:\n2012-10-04\n2012-10-04 to 2012-12-20\nOpening Theme:\n&quot;No Pain, No Game&quot; by Nano\n#2: &quot;Exist (Ã£â€šÂ¨Ã£â€šÂ°Ã£â€šÂ¸Ã£â€šÂ¹Ã£Æ’Ë†)&quot; by Nano (ep 12)\nEnding Theme:\n&quot;Aozora (Blue Skies)&quot; by May'n\n#2: &quot;No Pain, No Game&quot; by Nano (ep 12)\n\nSource: Btooom! - Complete Collection (Blu-Ray) 2013-12-10\n\nEpisode titles:\n\n2012-10-04\n1.\t\nStart\nstart\n\n2012-10-11\n2.\t\nThe Bloodstained High School Girl\nÃ¨Â¡â‚¬Ã£ï¿½Â®Ã¥Â¥Â³Ã¥Â­ï¿½Ã©Â«ËœÃ§â€Å¸\n\n2012-10-18\n3.\t\nSurvival\nÃ£â€šÂµÃ£Æ’ï¿½Ã£â€šÂ¤Ã£Æ’ï¿½Ã£Æ’Â«\n\n2012-10-25\n4.\t\nBest in the World\nÃ¤Â¸â€“Ã§â€¢Å’Ã£Æ’Â©Ã£Æ’Â³Ã£â€šÂ«Ã£Æ’Â¼\n\n2012-11-01\n5.\t\nAttack\nÃ¥Â¼Â·Ã¨Â¥Â²\n\n2012-11-08\n6.\t\nNight of Sacrifice\nÃ§â€Å¸Ã¨Â´â€žÃ£ï¿½Â®Ã¥Â¤Å“\n\n2012-11-15\n7.\t\nVirtual Bride\nÃ¤Â»Â®Ã¦Æ’Â³Ã¨Å Â±Ã¥Â«ï¿½\n\n2012-11-22\n8.\t\nWhite Ghost\nÃ§â„¢Â½Ã£ï¿½â€žÃ¤ÂºÂ¡Ã©Å“Å \n\n2012-11-29\n9.\t\nThe Strongest Player\nÃ¦Å“â‚¬Ã¥Â¼Â·Ã£Æ’â€”Ã£Æ’Â¬Ã£â€šÂ¤Ã£Æ’Â¤Ã£Æ’Â¼\n\n2012-12-06\n10.\t\nHigh Level\nÃ£Æ’ï¿½Ã£â€šÂ¤Ã£Æ’Â¬Ã£Æ’â„¢Ã£Æ’Â«\n\n2012-12-13\n11.\t\nRevival\nÃ¥Â¾Â©Ã¦Â´Â»\n\n2012-12-20\n12.\t\nBonds\nÃ§Âµâ€ \n\n\nVIDEO\nVideo Source: BD-U\nVideo Codec: H.264/AVC\nVideo Resolution: 1920x1080p HD (16:9)\nVideo FPS: 23.976\nBit Depth: 10-bit\nChapters: Yes\n\nAUDIO\nTrack 1: AAC 2.0 (English)\nTrack 2: AAC 2.0 (Japanese)\n\nSUBTITLES\nTrack 1: English Signs/Songs\nTrack 2: English Subtitles\nTrack 3: English Signs/Songs (Retail)\nTrack 4: English Subtitles (Retail)\n\n\n\nEpisode 5 is titled wrong [my bad] cheers to Abi group for subs.\nThese are 10bit encodes thus you need cccp codec pack to watch properly otherwise vlc will muck up.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:96d38a0de4c09e37ebb75a71d76c03860b975b80","amp;dn":"BTOOOM%21+Dual+Audio+1080p+Bluray-10bit","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"96d38a0de4c09e37ebb75a71d76c03860b975b80","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,211,138,13,228,192,158,55,235,183,90,113,215,108,3,134,11,151,91,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
