Instead of shade-tree mechanics,\nwe are now a nation of computer upgraders. Beefing up hard drives, RAM, and\nvideo cards has replaced carburetor tweaks and oil changes. (And weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re a less greasy nation for it!)\n\nMcGraw-Hill and CNET have compiled the most asked-for upgrades in this very\nclear set of projects. This may be one of the most essential titles in our series because itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s still a tricky world inside your PC case and, unlike working on a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢69 Ford, you canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t just figure out PC upgrades by looking at the parts.\nSome of this bookÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s projects are classic hardware jobs, like drive and memory upgrades or dual-monitor setups. Others are more software oriented, like setting up your PC as an IP phone or a living-room media center. And some projects are almost more of a user upgradeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the project on good practices and technology for backups fits that category!\n\nYou may also want to enjoy the hottest project in PCs today: virtualization. The\nidea of running more than one operating system on a single computer has been catching on in a big way. Macs and PCs now run on the same CPUs, Linux operating systems are desktop-friendly, and a certain dÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©tente has been reached that admits some operating systems are just better at some tasks than others. Now the question, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMac, Linux, or PC?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ can often be answered, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œYes.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nOne thing hasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t changed and thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the sharp metal edges inside your PCÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s case!\nSo put on some gloves, open your machine, thumb ahead in this book, and get ready\nto create a new PC out of your old one. We promise, your nails will still be clean when youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re done.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d7353e8b6521b72c15f0bf22527c36bc070f4bf","amp;dn":"Do-It-Yourself+Computer+Upgrade+Projects+%282008%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d7353e8b6521b72c15f0bf22527c36bc070f4bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,115,83,232,182,82,27,114,193,95,11,242,37,39,195,107,192,112,244,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
