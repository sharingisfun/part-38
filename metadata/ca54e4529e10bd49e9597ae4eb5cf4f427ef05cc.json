From the origins of banks to the rise of 'Chimerica', each programme deals with a financial 'big bang' that has changed the course of history\n\nThis week; Why do stock markets produce bubbles and busts? Professor Ferguson goes back to the origins of the joint stock company in Amsterdam and Paris. He draws telling parallels between the current stock market crash and the 18th-century Mississippi Bubble of Scottish financier John Law and the 2001 Enron bankruptcy. He shows why humans have a herd instinct when it comes to investment, and why no one can accurately predict when the bulls might stampede.  \n\n\nFor part 1: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4518814&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4518814&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor part 2, 4 and 5: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/umbraco1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/umbraco1&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor part 6:\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4596651\n\n\nThis program was originally uploaded by &quot;geclipse&quot; at thebox.bz \n- theboz.bz is a private torrent tracker.
