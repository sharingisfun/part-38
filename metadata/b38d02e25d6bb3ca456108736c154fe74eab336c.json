Former military cop Jack Reacher makes it all the way from snowbound South Dakota to his destination in northeastern Virginia, near Washington, D.C.: the headquarters of his old unit, the 110th MP. The old stone building is the closest thing to a home he ever had.\n\nReacher is there to meet--in person--the new commanding officer, Major Susan Turner, so far just a warm, intriguing voice on the phone.\n\nBut it isn't Turner behind the CO's desk. And Reacher is hit with two pieces of shocking news, one with serious criminal consequences, and one too personal to even think about.\n\nWhen threatened, you can run or fightÃ¢â‚¬Â¦.Reacher fights, aiming to find Turner and clear his name, barely a step ahead of the army, and the FBI, and the D.C. Metro police, and four unidentified thugs.\n\nCombining an intricate puzzle of a plot and an exciting chase for truth and justice, Lee Child puts Reacher through his paces--and makes him question who he is, what he's done, and the very future of his unlettered life on the open road.\n\n\nRead by Dick Hill\nFormat: MP3\nBitrate: 64 Kbps\nUnabridged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b38d02e25d6bb3ca456108736c154fe74eab336c","amp;dn":"Lee+Child+-+Never+Go+Back+%28Jack+Reacher+%2318%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b38d02e25d6bb3ca456108736c154fe74eab336c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,141,2,226,93,107,179,202,69,97,8,115,108,21,79,231,78,171,51,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
