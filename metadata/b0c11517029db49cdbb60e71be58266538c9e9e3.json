Power dressed with the shoulder pads of an unforgettable chapter of musical history, this 3CD collection is adorned with hits bigger than Diana Ross' hair!\n\n      Just as you 'Relax' into Frankie Goes To Hollywood, the tempo increases to a soulful disco-paced plethora of unforgettable tracks. As Kool &amp; The Gang 'Get Down On It' and Jocelyn Brown sings about 'Somebody Else's Guy,' the tracks from the days of cassette tapes and excess blusher hold a familiar, addictive quality that continues through to Lionel Richie's finale of 'All Night Long.' With popular artists ranging from The Jacksons to Earth, Wind And Fire, the diversity of funk, soul and disco gains momentum with the Flashdance-famed tracks 'What A Feeling' and 'Maniac', and then slows to a seductive sway with Donna Summer's 'I Feel Love' and the legendary Barry White. Bopping through 3 discs of catchy electronic funk until your feet hurt in your sneakers, this album captures a decade of rapturous variety in the world of music.\n\n      There is no getting away from the 80's revival that is sweeping the nation and Floorfillers 80's Club Classics is the ultimate album to get the party started. So, don your leg warmers and step back into the 'Funkytown' of synthesizer heaven.\n\nTrack List\t\n\n \n\n Disc 1\n\n   1. Frankie Goes To Hollywood - Relax\n   2. Diana Ross - Upside Down\n   3.
