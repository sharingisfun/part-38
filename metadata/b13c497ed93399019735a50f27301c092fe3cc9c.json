It was released on April 16, \n\n2002 by the independent label Second Nature Recordings. The album incorporates a \n\nnumber of folk elements (the predominance of acoustic guitar, the use of fiddle, and \n\nlyrics centered around the loneliness or isolation of the singer and his \n\nimpoverished background), but also contains clear strains of rock music. The major \n\nthemes of the album include his relationship with his wife and his dedication to \n\nmusic. The album received very little press upon its release, going unmentioned by \n\nboth the independent and mainstream music critic publications.\n\n   1. &quot;Crabtree And Evelyn&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:06\n   2. &quot;Holding Onto Water&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:47\n   3. &quot;October&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:03\n   4. &quot;Like Silver&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:03\n   5. &quot;Without Eyes Still Seeing&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:58\n   6. &quot;Don't Walk Out On Me&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:27\n   7. &quot;Treasure Chest&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:07\n   8. &quot;Swallowing Swords&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:51\n   9. &quot;Like A Mother&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:32\n  10. &quot;Deep In The Earth&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:42\n  11. &quot;I Remember Music&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:13\n\nEnjoy :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b13c497ed93399019735a50f27301c092fe3cc9c","amp;dn":"Rocky+Votolato+-+Burning+My+Travels+Clean","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b13c497ed93399019735a50f27301c092fe3cc9c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,60,73,126,217,51,153,1,151,53,165,15,39,48,28,9,47,227,204,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
