With influences as diverse as EINSTUERZENDE NEUBAUTEN, MINISTRY, RAMMSTEIN and FEINDFLUG, their songs are the weapons of mankind. JESUS AND THE GURUS are as ironic and cynical as ever before as evidenced by their lyrics. They still speak of all the themes unspoken. JESUS AND THE GURUS never capitulate.\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1863a61cf90eef4c9113b317d916dd8b1c087cb1","amp;dn":"Jesus+and+The+Gurus+-+Blood%2C+Sweat+and+Tears+%282009%29+%5Bmp3%40VBR%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1863a61cf90eef4c9113b317d916dd8b1c087cb1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,99,166,28,249,14,239,76,145,19,179,23,217,22,221,139,28,8,124,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
