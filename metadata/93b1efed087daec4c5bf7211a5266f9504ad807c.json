A king was a warrior who literally fought to win power then battled to keep it. Yet despite everything that stood in their way, a handful of extraordinary women did attempt to rule medieval and Tudor England. In this series, historian Dr Helen Castor explores seven queens who challenged male power, the fierce reactions they provoked and whether the term 'she wolves' was deserved.\n\nIn 1308 a 12-year-old girl, Isabella of France, became queen of England when she married the English king. A century later another young French girl, Margaret of Anjou, followed in her footsteps. Both these women were thrust into a violent and dysfunctional England and both felt driven to take control of the kingdom themselves. Isabella would be accused of murder and Margaret of destructive ambition - it was Margaret who Shakespeare named the She Wolf. But as historian Helen Castor reveals, their self-assertion that would have seemed natural in a man was deemed unnatural, even monstrous in a woman.\n\nBBC She Wolves, England's Early Queens 2 of 3 Isabella And Margaret 2012.avi\nFilesize......: 700Mb\nRuntime.......: 00:59:01\nVideo Codec...: XviD\nVideo Bitrate.: 1531Kbps\nFrame Size....: 624x352\nFrame Rate....: 25fps\nAudio Codec...: mp3\nAudio Bitrate.: 64bps\nAudio Freq....: 48KHz\nAudio Channels: Stereo\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:93b1efed087daec4c5bf7211a5266f9504ad807c","amp;dn":"She+Wolves+-+England%27s+Early+Queens+++%28BBC+2012+-+Part+2%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"93b1efed087daec4c5bf7211a5266f9504ad807c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,177,239,237,8,125,174,196,197,191,114,17,165,38,111,149,4,173,128,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
