In the\r\nprocess, Peter finds a letter written by his mother, declaring her love and assuring\r\nPeter they will meet again &quot;in this world or another&quot;.\r\n\r\nIn retaliation for the boys' mischief, Mother Barnabas summons pirates who kidnap Nibs\r\nand several others. Nibs managed to jump off the pirate ship and escape but Peter did\r\nnot, he was captured and taken to Neverland, a magical realm beyond space and time,\r\nwhere he is forced to become a slave laborer and mine for fairy dust on behalf of the\r\nruthless pirate Blackbeard (Hugh Jackman) and where Peter befriends another miner,\r\nJames Hook (Garrett Hedlund) After insulting Blackbeard's men, Peter is forced to walk\r\nthe plank, but survives by flying above the water. Blackbeard then confides with him\r\nabout an old prophecy that a boy who could fly would one day kill him, but Peter\r\nrefuses to believe he is the said boy.\r\n\r\nBox Office\r\n\r\nBudget: $150,000,000 (estimated)\r\nOpening Weekend: $15,315,435 (USA) (9 October 2015)\r\nGross: $34,879,080 (USA) (11 December 2015)\r\n \nhttp://images.geotorrents.ge/images/70542918698463754897.png  \r\n \nhttp://images.geotorrents.ge/images/53524735854096727731.png\r\n \nhttp://images.geotorrents.ge/images/85428338894762225477.png\r\n \nhttp://images.geotorrents.ge/images/05765913344761268653.png\r\n \nhttp://images.geotorrents.ge/images/70940993513755387320.png  \r\n \nhttp://images.geotorrents.ge/images/76948063171876165133.png\r\n \nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt3332064/\r\n\r\n:: General ::\r\n\r\nFormat: Matroska/MKV\r\nFile Size: 12.2 GiB\r\nOverall Bit Rate: 14.9 Mbps\r\nFormat profile:   \r\nDuration: 01:51:32\r\nSample: Yes\r\nSubtitles: English\r\nChapters: Yes\r\nEncoded By oneanight\r\n\r\n:: Video Info ::\r\n\r\nCodec ID: V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\r\nWriting library: x264\r\nVideo bitrate: 10 MB\r\nResolution: 1920 X 800 pixels\r\nAspect ratio(AR): 2.40:1\r\nFrame Rate: 23.976 fps\r\n\r\n:: Audio Info ::\r\n\r\nFormat profile: Atmos / TrueHD\r\nAudio Bit rate: 8094 Kbps\r\nCompression mode: Lossless\r\nBit rate mode Variable\r\nAudio Language: English\r\nSampling rate: 48.0 KHz / Bit depth 24 bits\r\nChannel positions: Front: L C R, Side: L R, Back: L R, LFE\r\nChannels: 8 channels 7.1\r\n\r\nPLEASE SEED - PLEASE SHARE - PLEASE UPLOAD","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b2d6633656be9e0a72122ea2a1fe674209c9887e","amp;dn":"Pan+-+%5B2015%5D+1080p+BluRay+x264+TrueHD+%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b2d6633656be9e0a72122ea2a1fe674209c9887e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,214,99,54,86,190,158,10,114,18,46,162,161,254,103,66,9,201,136,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
