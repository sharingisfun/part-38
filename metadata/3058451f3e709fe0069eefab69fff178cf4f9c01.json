Y changes between the EMP and spike weapons you pick up as bonus items, and L trigger fires them.\n\nStandard brakes are completely useless - only your handbrake is of any use as it initiates an awkward drift around the mostly gentle corners. Bizarrely, gently holding left will turn your car right, and vice versa.\n\nThe game also scales the speed of opponents to that of the automobile you're driving. So if you're in a slow ambulance you stand a better chance of locking up criminals than in a super car, as speed isn't a factor and the ambulance is easier to drive.\n\nThat's right: Crash Time 3D rewards you if you opt for the slower cars.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3058451f3e709fe0069eefab69fff178cf4f9c01","amp;dn":"Crash+Time+3D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3058451f3e709fe0069eefab69fff178cf4f9c01","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,88,69,31,62,112,159,224,6,158,239,171,105,255,241,120,207,79,156,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
