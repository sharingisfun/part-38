This fascinating documentary, interviews the soldiers who fought at Omaha, \nrecalling their experiences as they approached the shore line under intense \ncross fire. Using CGI graphics to recreate and illustrate what happened on D \nDay, the programme also explores the weaponry used in the first wave of the \ninvasion.Omaha Beach is the code name for one of the five sectors of the Allied \ninvasion of German-occupied France in the Normandy landings on 6 June 1944, \nduring World War II. The beach is located on the coast of Normandy, France, \nfacing the English Channel, and is 5 miles (8 km) long, from east of Sainte-\nHonorine-des-Pertes to west of Vierville-sur-Mer on the right bank of the Douve \nRiver estuary. Landings here were necessary in order to link up the British \nlandings to the east at Gold Beach with the American landing to the west at Utah \nBeach, thus providing a continuous lodgement on the Normandy coast of the Bay of \nthe Seine. Taking Omaha was to be the responsibility of United States Army \ntroops, with sea transport and naval artillery support provided by the U.S. Navy \nand elements of the British Royal Navy.\n\nOn D-Day, the untested 29th Infantry Division, joined by the veteran 1st \nInfantry Division and nine companies of U.S. Army Rangers redirected from Pointe \ndu Hoc, were to assault the western half of the beach. The battle-hardened 1st \nInfantry Division was given the eastern half. The initial assault waves, \nconsisting of tanks, infantry, and combat engineer forces, were carefully \nplanned to reduce the coastal defenses and allow the larger ships of the \nfollow-up waves to land.\n\nScreenshots:\n\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/kYgU0e7.jpg[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/kdj5Rsr.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/7cNiCTk.gif[/IMG]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fed43491be44f4ab8791ed87a5128430aaffb3d6","amp;dn":"Surviving+D-Day+%28Documentary%29+2011+x264+THADOGG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fed43491be44f4ab8791ed87a5128430aaffb3d6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,212,52,145,190,68,244,171,135,145,237,135,165,18,132,48,170,255,179,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
