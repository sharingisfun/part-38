For Pa / (For Ma) (04:13)\n\nThe 4onthefloorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s debut record, 4Ãƒâ€”4, is one of the best rock and roll records of 2011, by far.\n\nThe 16-track LP has loads of hits and is led by the bearded, lumberjack-looking frontman, Gabriel Douglas.\n\nComing out of Minnesota the guys blends blues, country and southern rock to create one hard-hitting sound.\n\nTheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re the new Black Keys, before the Keys became mainstream.\n\nWhere do I start when it comes to the record?\n\nYouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve got Ã¢â‚¬Å“Lionhearted,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ an up-tempo track that makes you want to drink, party and have a shit-kicking good time.\n\nDid I mention every single one of the guys has a kick drum?\n\nWho ever came up with that idea deserves a beer!\n\nOnly two tracks after Ã¢â‚¬Å“LionheartedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is Ã¢â‚¬Å“Junkie.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Yeah, the track is about what youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re exactly thinking, someone under the influence and constantly with the urge to feed an addiction. Somehow the vocals of Douglas seep into your bones and you feel his screams, the pounding drums and heavy riffs.\n\nYou think the band would be done by the time you reach the end of the album but then you get to Ã¢â‚¬Å“Cashillac.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s simple, not too many notes on the guitar, just a thumping kick drum and Douglas ripping the mic apart. It would make Johnny Cash proud.\n\nThe band gets country on Ã¢â‚¬Å“For Pa/For Ma.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nThe entire record is non-stop fun.\n\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a shame this band is currently unsigned; we need more bands like this, less gimmicks and more music.\n\nThe 4onthefloor have something the whole world needs to hear. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m looking forward to seeing these guys live and more music from them.\n\nOther great tracks are Ã¢â‚¬Å“You DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Forget LostÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ andÃ¢â‚¬Å“Bricklayer.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:806d45309fac7e71303c423c17c2f3e82ca56a3e","amp;dn":"the+4onthefloor+-+4x4+%5B2011%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"806d45309fac7e71303c423c17c2f3e82ca56a3e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,109,69,48,159,172,126,113,48,60,66,60,23,194,243,232,44,165,106,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
