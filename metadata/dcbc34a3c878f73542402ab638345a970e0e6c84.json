This first album from 1976, heretofore a difficult find, has just been reissued on CD in Korea. A five-piece of guitars, keys, drums and bass, fronted by capable lead vocalist Rafael Cabrera, who often changes from a near folksy familiarity to an operatic vengeance in a matter of moments. The sound tends to be keyboard driven, although not overly complex, and is supported well by the rhythm section and good writing. Their style is fairly original, elements of rock, classical, blues, folk and other forms in various extended arrangements, with changing tempos and rhythmic textures.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dcbc34a3c878f73542402ab638345a970e0e6c84","amp;dn":"Tarantula+-+Tarantula+I+%281976%29+%5B1993+Reissue%5D+%5BEAC-FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dcbc34a3c878f73542402ab638345a970e0e6c84","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,188,52,163,200,120,247,53,66,64,42,182,56,52,90,151,14,14,108,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
