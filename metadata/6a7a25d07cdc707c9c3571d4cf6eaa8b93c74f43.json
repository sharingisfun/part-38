For those listeners who do not wish to invest in the tenor saxophonist's &quot;complete&quot; eight-CD Milestone box set, this single-CD is a good place to start in investigating his middle period music. Henderson is featured in a sextet with trumpeter Mike Lawrence, trombonist Grachan Moncur III, pianist Kenny Barron, bassist Ron Carter and drummer Louis Hayes on a well-rounded set highlighted by &quot;Mamacita,&quot; &quot;Chelsea Bridge,&quot; &quot;If,&quot; &quot;Without a Song&quot; and &quot;Nardis.&quot; (AllMusic)\n\nTrack list:\n01 - Mamacita\n02 - The Kicker\n03 - Chelsea Bridge\n04 - If\n05 - Nardis\n06 - Without A Song\n07 - O Amor Em Paz\n08 - Mo' Joe\n\nPersonnel:\nJoe Henderson: tenor saxophone\nMike Lawrence: trumpet\nGrachan Moncur III: trombone\nKenny Barron: piano\nRon Carter: bass\nLouis Hayes: drums\n\nEnjoy and share!
