The opening &quot;Don't Know Why&quot; is the litmus test: the version here is nearly identical to the rendition on Come Away With Me, its impressive marriage of cocktail jazz and coffeehouse folk already solidified. Likewise, Jones' alluring readings of &quot;Come Away With Me,&quot; &quot;Turn Me On,&quot; and &quot;Lonestar&quot; anticipate the more robust versions captured on the LP. First Sessions is also worth seeking out because it contains a pair of songs yet to surface anywhere else -- the Jesse Harris original &quot;Something Is Calling You&quot; and more intriguingly, a cover of jazz legend Horace Silver's &quot;Peace.&quot; (AllMusic)\nIt's still my favorite Nora Jones album.\n\nTrack list:\n01 - Don't Know Why\n02 - Come Away With Me\n03 - Something Is Calling You\n04 - Turn Me On\n05 - Lonestar\n06 - Peace\n\nEnjoy and share!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:366d25754d3be4607eda6e023cbe755c41b191de","amp;dn":"Norah+Jones+-+2001+-+First+Sessions+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"366d25754d3be4607eda6e023cbe755c41b191de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,109,37,117,77,59,228,96,126,218,110,2,60,190,117,92,65,177,145,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
