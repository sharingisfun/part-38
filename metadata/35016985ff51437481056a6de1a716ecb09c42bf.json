Helen invites her in and gives her a cup of hot cocoa. Strangely however, Markie seems to know a great deal about her - that she doesn't like marshmallows in her cocoa or that she has a scar on her elbow. She also knows what Helen did earlier that day including seeing a somewhat familiar man, Peter Selden, behind the wheel of a car. When Selden arrives at her apartment a few moments later he says he worked for her mother but Helen has no memory of what happened to her mother all those years ago. As her memories return however, she finds herself in grave danger.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:35016985ff51437481056a6de1a716ecb09c42bf","amp;dn":"The+Twilight+Zone+-+Nightmare+As+A+Child","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"35016985ff51437481056a6de1a716ecb09c42bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,1,105,133,255,81,67,116,129,5,106,109,225,167,22,236,176,156,66,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
