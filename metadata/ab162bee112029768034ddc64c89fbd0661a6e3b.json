(Complete) &quot;37&quot; Tracks. Unofficial.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough there is an official movie soundtrack out there, I just thought I'd jazz it up a little. Here is MY version of the original soundtrack with a bunch of extras. I've pulled a number of sound grabs from the movie and also embedded a relevant screenshot to each track. And being somewhat of a central number to the &quot;Smith&quot; universe, I've limited it to 37 files.\r\n\r\nThe following tracks are in chronological order and all tags are correct. Hope you all enjoy this 15 year anniversary tribute, to what I consider to be one Smith's most mediocre/tolerable films.\r\n\r\n1.  Life's Been Good.mp3\r\n2.  Jay's Rap.mp3\r\n3.  A Smooth Pimp and a Man Servant.mp3\r\n4.  The Devil's Song.mp3\r\n5.  Interlued Cue Music+Tube of Wonderful.mp3\r\n6.  Choked Up.mp3\r\n7.  Cyber Savvy.mp3\r\n8.  Holden on Affleck.mp3\r\n9.
