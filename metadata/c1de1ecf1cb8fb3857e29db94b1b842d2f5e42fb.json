We are reminded of how the Lord works in the lives of ordinary people, helping us to conquer sin. In this excerpt from the book, Saints for Sinners, the incredible lives of these Saints testify to the truth of God's transforming love in those who are willing to surrender their lives to Him. These are the stories of St. Augustine of Hippo and St. Margaret of Cortona.\r\n \nhttps://www.lighthousecatholicmedia.org/store/title/saints-for-sinners-the-lives-of-st-augustine-and-st-margaret\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf you enjoy this presentation, please seed and support Lighthouse Catholic Media, NFP, which is a 501(c)(3) Not For Profit Company that seeks to answer the call for a New Evangelization.
