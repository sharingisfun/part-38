It consisted of 16 instrumental tracks and two covers of &quot;Mad World&quot; by Tears for Fears.\n\nThe score was not put on a soundtrack album until Andy Factor, a friend of Michael Andrews, released it on his Everloving Records independent label in 2002. As Donnie Darko was not a hit at first, there was little interest in the soundtrack in the United States. However, the film enjoyed more popularity in Europe especially in the UK where its total box office was greater than for the whole of the U.S., and so the Donnie Darko soundtrack album was released.\n\nThis sparked interest in the soundtrack and in the song &quot;Mad World,&quot; taken from the original soundtrack, which was a 2003 Christmas Number One in the UK singles chart. It has also made the charts in a number of other countries including Ireland, Denmark, the Netherlands and Australia in 2003 and 2004.\n\n____________________________\n\nBrought to you by TQMP.
