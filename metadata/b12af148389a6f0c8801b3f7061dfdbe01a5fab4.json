Monsanto's GMO boom rolls along like a juggernaut while those who profit turn a blind eye to the dangers and abuses.\n\nMore than 18 million hectares are covered by this GMO soya but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not solely a matter of soya because over this plant on this huge surface more than 300 million litres of the pesticide Roundup have been used .\n\nThe dirty war to kill off campesinos to make way for the plantations, and doctors and scientists claim that babies are being born with crippling birth malformations, and that in recent years the incidence of childhood cancer has soared. These are regarded as 'historical' or just anecdotal.  But they are phenomena  that have coincided with the introduction of Monsanto's GMO seeds and pesticides.\n\n(edited description)\n\nflv:http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/peopleandpower/2013/03/201331313434142322.html\n\nSee also: \n\nThe World According to Monsanto https://onebigtorrent.org/torrents/4558/The-World-According-to-Monsanto-2008--High-Quality-\n\nWorld According to Monsanto Kindle Version (ebook) http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7920934/World_According_to_Monsanto_Kindle_Version\n\n\nUnreported World ~Paraguay's Painful Harvest 2008 11 07 (Ch 4) https://onebigtorrent.org/torrents/4167/Unreported-World-Paraguays-Painful-Harvest-2008-11-07-Ch-4\n\nKeiser Report: Monsanto and Seeds of Evil 2011 01 04 RT America &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://onebigtorrent.org/torrents/11657/Keiser-Report-Monsanto-and-Seeds-of-Evil-2011-01-04-RT-America&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://onebigtorrent.org/torrents/11657/Keiser-Report-Monsanto-and-Seeds-of-Evil-2011-01-04-RT-America&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\nXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b12af148389a6f0c8801b3f7061dfdbe01a5fab4","amp;dn":"Argentina%27s+Bad+Seeds++2013+AJE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b12af148389a6f0c8801b3f7061dfdbe01a5fab4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,42,241,72,56,154,111,12,136,1,179,247,6,29,253,190,1,165,250,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
