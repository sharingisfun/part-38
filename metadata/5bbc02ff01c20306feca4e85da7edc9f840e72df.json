Helena, who recently broke up with Ã¢â‚¬Å“This Magic MomentÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ co-star Roberto Molinez (Vincent Spano), asks her new friend Clark to pretend to be her love interest in order to make Roberto jealous. Clark agrees and in exchange, Helena helps him pursue his screenwriting career. While this agreement benefits both Clark and Helena, it also complicates the relationship between Clark and his newly single ex-girlfriend, Emily McIntyre (Alaina Huffman).\n\nAs the director Doyle Duncan (Charles Shaughnessy) begins to wrap production, Clark finds himself caught between his admiration for the famous beauty and his feelings for former high school sweetheart. With whom will he find his happy ending?\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Cast / Bios\n\tDiane Neal\nHelena Harris\n\tTravis Schuldt\nClark Gable\n\tVincent Spano\nRoberto Molinez\n\tAlaina Huffman\nEmily McIntyre\n\tCharles Shaughnessy\nDoyle Duncan\n\tMolly Burnett\nJustine Gable\n\tRobin Riker\nMaryellen Gable\n \n\t\n\nDiane Neal / Helena Harris\n\nDiane Neal is best known for her role on &quot;Law and Order: SVU.&quot; She first appeared on the show in 2001 as a murderous villain in one of her very first acting jobs. Neal then reappeared, in classic &quot;Law and Order&quot; style, as the justice-driven ADA Casey Novak from 2003-2012. Since 2009 she has also recurred as GibbsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ doppelganger, CGIS Special Agent Abigail Borin, on &quot;NCIS&quot; and for two seasons as Alison Holt on &quot;Suits.&quot; Neal has also guest starred on a wide variety of other hit shows from &quot;White Collar&quot; to &quot;30 Rock&quot; and has appeared in numerous films and television movies.\n\nWith over a decade of playing tough-as-nails good guys and bad guys, it comes as a surprise to many fans that Neal is also a stand up comic. Although difficult to book consistently while filming, for years she has made audiences laugh all over New York City and Los Angeles. She can routinely be seen at Stand Up New York, her home club, and Upright CitizenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Brigade Los Angeles. She also enjoys appearing in the hip and hysterical storytelling show DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Tell My Mother produced by Nikki Levy.\n\nNeal was born in Alexandria, Virginia, moved to Littleton, Colorado at age eight, then to Oahu, Hawaii for college another eight years later. Thanks to her older sister, she started modeling and was fortunate enough to live and work in myriad countries in Asia and Europe. Neal landed in New York City, the city she still calls home and serendipitously found herself at the Atlantic Theater Company Acting School in 1999.\n\nA life-long learner, Neal is very proud to currently be an undergraduate student at Harvard University. Her areas of interest include everything from Classical Archaeology to Neuroscience and Biology. Previous to Harvard, Neal has taken classes as wide-ranging as Ã¢â‚¬Å“Predators of the OutbackÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ handling dangerous wildlife in Australia at Uluru and the often handy Ã¢â‚¬Å“Coconut Opening 101Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ in the Caribbean.\n\nNeal whole-heartedly believes in philanthropy and is on the artistic board and is a full participant in the Urban Arts Partnership under the tutelage of fellow actor Rosie Perez, as well as actively working with the Thirst Project, the RFK Center for Human Rights, Water Keeper and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, to name a few.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5bbc02ff01c20306feca4e85da7edc9f840e72df","amp;dn":"This+Magic+Moment_HDTV.x264_TTL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5bbc02ff01c20306feca4e85da7edc9f840e72df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,188,2,255,1,194,3,6,254,202,78,133,218,126,220,159,132,14,114,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
