Av not got it perfect but its certainly a huge improvement over the r5. Av ran a light blender and ma fav sharpner over it as well to clean and enhance.\n\nAudio: This was a nightmare. First off i faced a massive sync job wi this. It took me nearly 8 hrs. IFLIX was a different frame rate but it was also cut to ribbons. Hence there are several short gaps in the audio. Its basic sensorship clippings. Av padded them out using silence to help keep sync. Ironicly enuff, iflix ppv had extra footage that wasnt in the r5. It lingered on some battle scenes longer than the r5 so i had to trim out some audio as well. Fyi, sync is very tight in this all the way. I put alot of effort into getting it just right.\nNow your probably wondering why i didnt mux this with the russian surround channels. I did origionaly but had to abandon it. There was to much russian speech on the surround channels, overlaying the english audio. Soz peeps but no multichannel this time :(\n\nWe Are Looking For Early Access To Anything You Can Provide CAMS, TS, DVD Screeners, VHS Screeners, DVDRips, Direct Audio, Early Music Releases - Contact Us @ &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;45362a3037262036052e2c2b22212a28682e3326216b2b2031&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nGreets: KingBen, BLaZE, KK, Paulx1, DiNGiE, jojo - All Of Kingdom &amp; UKB, STG, IMAGiNE, The GRiM, Ho's, And All Else We Respect, You Know Who Yall Are ;)\n\n\nScreens:\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/12520322063882681690.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/12520322063882681690.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/34459336335114555648.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/34459336335114555648.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/30289102566358643289.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/30289102566358643289.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nENJOY!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:515f94c6a2a171a28be457dab32629e9eee91b4a","amp;dn":"The+Eagle+2011+R5+XviD-DD+%28Kingdom+Release%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"515f94c6a2a171a28be457dab32629e9eee91b4a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,95,148,198,162,161,113,162,139,228,87,218,179,38,41,233,238,233,27,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
