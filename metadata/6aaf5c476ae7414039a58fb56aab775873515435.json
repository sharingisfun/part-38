You'll hear Piedmont, Ragtime, Delta, Texas and Chicago here, all deftly played by a person that Happy Traum has called a 'Fingerpicking Guitar Wizard.\n' \nAll of the songs were played on a wide variety of vintage guitars - ranging from a 1900 Columbia Parlor guitar, a 1930 National Steel, a rare 1960 electric Stratatone, a 1935 Gibson L-00 and some old Harmony guitars that are what Toby calls 'cosmetic train wrecks.\n' However old or beat up, these instruments sure bring out sounds that the old time blues calls for. \nBacking Toby on a number of tracks is his wife, Carol Walker, who plays the upright bass in a style reminiscent of the great Willie Dixon.\n\n\nTracklist:\n1 Shake Shake Mama \n2 Crazy 'Bout An Automobile \n3 Mama Tain't Long for the Day \n4 Travelin' Riverside Blues \n5 Keep On Truckin' Mama \n6 Tootie Blues \n7 Keep Your Lamp Trimmed and Burnin' \n8 I Got To Love Somebody \n9 Midnight Special \n10 Shuffle Rag \n11 Can't Be Satisfied \n12 What's the Matter Now \n13 Meat Shakin' Woman \n14 Broke Down Engine \n15 She's 19 Years Old \n16 Cigarette Blues\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6aaf5c476ae7414039a58fb56aab775873515435","amp;dn":"Little+Toby+Walker+-+Shake+Shake+Mama+%282011%29%28blues%29%28mp3%40320%29%5Brog","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6aaf5c476ae7414039a58fb56aab775873515435","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,175,92,71,106,231,65,64,57,165,143,181,106,171,119,88,115,81,84,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
