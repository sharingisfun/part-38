It is 2.4 GB in size.\n\nThe documentary deals with the USS Liberty Incident which occurred during the 1967 Arab-Israeli War, AKA the Six-Day War. (At the time, the USS Liberty was a US Navy reconnaissance ship.) Although characterized by the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) as a &quot;friendly-fire incident,&quot; the USS Liberty Incident remains enigmatic. The facts do not support the Israeli Government's official explanations of the events and the US Government's handling of the matter suggests a cover-up.\n\nIt has been said regarding this event that if the Israelis had truly wanted to sink the ship that it would have been sunk. Again, this is another source of contention. The Israeli position that there were, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œfailures in communications between Israel and the U.S.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and, additionally, that there was a &quot;...chain of mistakes by Israel Defense Force (IDF) personnel&quot; would imply a certain degree of ineptitude on the part of the Israelis. In this case, is it so surprising that their attacks were unsuccessful?\n\nThe fact that the USS Liberty was attacked by UNMARKED planes (a WAR CRIME under International Law) is another mystery. Or is it? As the documentary suggests, was the USS Liberty listening in on the IDF as they drove through the Sinai Peninsula and as the IDF (ostensibly) engaged in activities that they would not have wanted the USS Liberty to be eavesdropping on? \n\n\nAt any rate, this is a fascinating documentary about a little known event.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFor more information on the USS Liberty Incident, please check the following link:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Liberty_incident&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Liberty_incident&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nFor further context, please refer to these links as well:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six-Day_War&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six-Day_War&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_flag&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_flag&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavon_Affair&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavon_Affair&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8feeac08ad4c88b2418b9a2488926130ae96bc9","amp;dn":"DVD+-+USS+Liberty+Incident","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a8feeac08ad4c88b2418b9a2488926130ae96bc9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,254,234,192,138,212,200,139,36,24,185,162,72,137,38,19,10,233,107,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
