There where a few redundant mods that were left out.  I also left out any mods that required .esp's or .bsa's etc.\n\nThis mod consists ONLY of a &quot;Textures&quot; and &quot;Meshes&quot; folder.  No *.esp files.  No .bsa files, etc...  Should be compatible with all other mods, especially if this is installed first.\n\nREQUIREMENTS\n------------\n\nI personally run this on an I5 quad core with 8 gigs of system memory.  I use ENB Series (RealVision) with ENBoost to manage the memory on my GeForce GTX 650 ti with TWO gigs of video memory.\n\nThe important requirement here is 2 gigs of video ram.  Skyrim's graphics engine has a memory limit of 3 point something odd...  If you exceed the limit the game will crash.\n\n** WARNING ** If you don't have at least 2 gigs of video ram to displace the size of these textures, the game will crash.\n\n** WARNING ** While these textures will perform very well on any modern video board, they are large files and will take time to load into memory.  As a result, your game will look and run great...  But your loading times will be drastically increased.  (A Solid State Drive my help with this)\n\nINSTALLATION\n------------\n\nYou can probably add the .zip file directly to Nexus Mod Manager and install from there.  However, I simply installed these manually and then used NMM for other stuff.\n\nTo Manually Install, simply unzip the &quot;Textures&quot; and &quot;Meshes&quot; folders to the &quot;Data&quot; folder on your Skyrim Installation.  (Most likely C:Program Files X86SteamSteamAppsCommonSkyrimData)\n\nYou will most likely be asked to merge to existing folders and overwrite some files.  Answer &quot;Yes&quot; to all.\n\nList of Individual Mods Included\n--------------------------------\n\nThis texture pack is a blend of the following mods.\n\nSkyrim HD - 2K Textures\nSerious HD Retexture Skyrim\nSkyrim Realistic Overhaul\nAOF Detailed Mountains\nAOF Farmhouses\nAsh Pile Retex\nBellyaches Animal and Creature Pack\nBryce Nebula - Skyrim Galaxy Replacer\nDesigns of the Nords\nDetailed Chests\nDetailed Rugs\nDwemer Metal Retexture\nEnhanced Distant Terrain\nHD Misc\nHD Ore and Ingots\nHD Sacks Retexture\nHD Soul Gems\nHectrol Caves Deluxe HighRes Retex\nHigh Definition Ivy\nHigh Quality Food and Ingredients\nHigh Quality Workbench\nHQ Papaer\nHQ Skyrim Map V2\nHQ Towns and Villages\nHybrids HD Plants and Herbs Retexture\nNo Stretching\nQuality SnowFlakes V2\nReal Ice and Snow\nRealistic Instruments\nRealistic Smoke and Embers\nRiften HQ Textures\nRuins Clutter Improved\nSeptim HD\nSilly Level of Detail - Potions and Poisons\nSilly Level of Detail - Wine Cellar\nSkyrim Sunglare V4\nSnow and Rocks Textures HD\nTobes Highres Textures\nTreesHD Skyrim Variation\nWeathered Road Signs\n\n( 40 Count !! )  &lt;Eye Candy Alert&gt;\n\nRecommendations\n---------------\n\nInstall a clean un-modded copy of Skyrim. (On an SSD if you can)  Manually Copy the Textures and Meshes folders from this pack into the Data folder of your clean Skyrim Installation.  Overwrite all files.\n\nNow.  Use Nexus Mod Manager or Steam Workshop to mod other things.  Install SkyUI, Bags and Bandoliers, Cloaks of Skyrim, Immersive Weapons, Immersive Armors, and maybe the aMidianBorn texture packs for Immersive Weapons and Armor.  Etc Etc.  Have Fun!\n\n** PLEASE SEED!  My Upload speed sucks, so I need ya to seed a bit.  Thanks 'N' Stuff.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:732f52ec927bde51bd87202eb17a0148869da994","amp;dn":"Humongous+Skyrim+Texture+Pack+%28From+Texture+Pack+Combiner%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"732f52ec927bde51bd87202eb17a0148869da994","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,47,82,236,146,123,222,81,189,135,32,46,177,122,1,72,134,157,169,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
