Not too much I think. Otherwise you are just an egoistic parasite who does not care for other people violating the idea behind this wonderful feature.\n\nAfter more than 150 uploads I think I may ask this. Less than 3% are willing to share for more than a day. I know I speak for a lot of people who - just like me - hate it, to keep uploading for just a greedy bunch. I hope you think higher of yourself.\n\nEnjoy,\n\n\n\nDutch Sweet - #04 Mrs. Cold (Easy Rock)\n\n01 - Se Acaba El Vals (Pedro Javier Hermosilla)\n02 - Song Of Sand (Suzanne Vega)\n03 - Never Be You (Guy Sebastian)\n04 - Vegetable Car (Joshua Radin)\n05 - Easy (Alain Clark)\n06 - Fail To Mention (Guy Sebastian)\n07 - Cello Song (The Books Ft.
