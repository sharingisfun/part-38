Rosemarie Lemon is unhappy with the support she is getting from her family for her dreams. She meets a sensitive truck driver, Drew Rothman (Michael Ontkean), and they become lovers. Rothman's family is full of hatred for the world and ridicules his dream of becoming a singer. Their common ambitions and need for support make their relationship stronger, as each pursues a dream. Director Robert Markowitz uses rock &amp; roll songs to fill in the parts in the movie where Lemon's deafness is emphasized. The soundtrack includes tunes by Burton Cummings, Tom Petty, and Willie Nelson.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080103/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080103/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 01:45:38\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 704x400  16/9\nCodec : DivX (4 / 5 / 6)\nFPS : 23,98\nBitRate : 1599 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,24 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 256 Kbps\n\n\nPlease seed at least as much as you D/L.\n\nDon't hit and run.\n=======================================\nThanks \n\nJohn\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/johnefp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/johnefp&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3df7df69638fb1925653c4dc2f6c8c6ec41a33ef","amp;dn":"Voices+%281979%29+Michael+Ontkean+Eng","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3df7df69638fb1925653c4dc2f6c8c6ec41a33ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,247,223,105,99,143,177,146,86,83,196,220,47,108,140,110,196,26,51,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
