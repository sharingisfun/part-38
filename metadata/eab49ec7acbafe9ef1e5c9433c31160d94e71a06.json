Curtis is displeased with Charlotte's behavior, something that slowly but surely drives a new wedge between them. At the same time, Curtis is consumed with church business, and trying to uncover who is behind a series of mysterious letters that threaten to expose Curtis's biggest secret. Increasingly furious with his mother, Matthew gives Charlotte an ultimatum--treat Racquel and her mom with respect or she'll be cut off from seeing the baby altogether. This sends Charlotte down a road of revenge. Once again, the Black household is torn apart, and it will take a miracle for anyone to recover.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eab49ec7acbafe9ef1e5c9433c31160d94e71a06","amp;dn":"A+House+Divided+-+Kimberla+Lawson+Roby","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eab49ec7acbafe9ef1e5c9433c31160d94e71a06","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,180,158,199,172,186,254,158,241,229,201,67,60,49,22,13,148,231,26,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
