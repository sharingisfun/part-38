Warming up with &quot;Could You Be Loved&quot; and &quot;Feeling Alright,&quot; Cocker soon finds his footing and launches into the Scotch whiskey soul of &quot;Have a Little Faith,&quot; the kinky comedy of &quot;You Can Leave Your Hat On,&quot; and the gospel-flushed agony of &quot;When the Night Comes.&quot; A take on Van Morrison&amp;#039;s &quot;Into the Mystic&quot; is welcome, while &quot;Don&amp;#039;t Let Me Be Misunderstood&quot; mines the old Animals chestnut for further blues testimony. The crumpled valentine of &quot;You Are So Beautiful&quot; is touchingly familiar and dedicated, on this occasion, to the late Princess Diana. In all, Cocker is in very good, professional form here, a tempered force of nature, perhaps, but an expressive stylist of mature conviction. --Tom Keogh\n\nJoe Cocker&amp;#039;s Across From Midnight captures his 1997 performance at Waldbuhne, Berlin. His 17-song, 86-minute performance includes hits like &quot;Feelin&amp;#039; Alright,&quot; &quot;Up Where We Belong,&quot; &quot;You Are So Beautiful,&quot; and &quot;You Can Leave Your Hat On.&quot; Inspired cover choices such as &quot;The Letter,&quot; &quot;Please Don&amp;#039;t Let Me Be Misunderstood,&quot; and &quot;Into the Mystic&quot; round out an entertaining set list.\n\nTrack Listing:\n1.
