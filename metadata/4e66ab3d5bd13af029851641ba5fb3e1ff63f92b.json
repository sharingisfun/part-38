Bernie LittleÃ¢â‚¬â€came to meet before their first big case in Dog On It.As fans know, Chet first met Bernie on that fateful day when he flunked out of K-9 police school. The details of that day though have always remained a little vague (like so much in ChetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s doggy brain). All we know is that Chet had been the best leaper in his K-9 class, but for some reason he failed his final leaping test...and that a cat was involved...and that there was some blood. But whose? The test, the cat, the bloodÃ¢â‚¬â€all pieces of a puzzle that, when solved, will bring down a dangerous gang of thievesÃ¢â‚¬â€and signal the start of a beautiful friendship.\n\nThis fateful day has been alluded to in every book in the series, and now fans of Chet and Bernie will finally get to find out what actually happened. For these two beloved characters, it was something like love at first sightÃ¢â‚¬â€and, for Chet, at first smell, too.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e66ab3d5bd13af029851641ba5fb3e1ff63f92b","amp;dn":"A+Cat+Was+Involved+-+Spencer+Quinn.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e66ab3d5bd13af029851641ba5fb3e1ff63f92b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,102,171,61,91,209,58,240,41,133,22,65,186,95,179,225,255,99,249,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
