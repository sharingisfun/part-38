To help get her career back on track, Toni enlists the help of her four younger sisters, all of whom are performers in their own right. \n\nToni plans to perform at a benefit concert in Bermuda, and she invites them to accompany her. Traci, the second eldest sister, moved away ten years earlier, and misses her sisters. Middle child Towanda is Tonis assistant, but is tired of performing that duty, and wants to get back into performing. Trina, the second youngest, is a backup singer who tends to party too hard. Tamar, the baby of the family, is married to Tonis manager and successful record producer Vincent Herbert. Shes also sings backup, but believes shes destined for a solo career. \n\nTamar and Trina get together to prepare to sing backup for Toni, and Tamar throws a fit when she learns Toni wont be at the rehearsal. The sisters are shocked when Trina confides she was arrested for a DUI. The girls mother, Evelyn, watches her grandchildren while Toni and her sisters head for Bermuda. But tensions continue to mount as Traci reveals she feels left out that she wont be performing, and Tamar feuds with Vince over his perceived unwillingness to help her with her career. \n\nAs Toni worries about how her performance will be received, Tamar and Vince separately come to her seeking her counsel, and she advises them. In spite of Tonis fears, the concert is a success, marred only by Tracis tears over being on the sidelines. But Towanda manages to comfort her, and she feels better having expressed her frustrations, and decides to get back into singing. The sisters plan to have a post-concert slumber party, but Toni falls asleep alone in her room. Tamar and Vince come to an understanding that hell make her career a higher priority. The sisters return home to Atlanta, to an exhausted Evelyns relief.\n\n\n\nLooking for DSR,HDTV Cappers, EU 100/1000mbit AFFIL sites\n@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@\nWe are new..so what?
