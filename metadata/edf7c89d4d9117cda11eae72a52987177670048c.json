In this book, Bent Sorenson provides strategies for the efficient conversion, transmission and storage of all forms of renewable energy. \n\nThe book provides the reader with a complete background on how renewable energy is transformed into power and the best methods for transmitting and storing the energy produced. Specific to this book is a discussion of conversion processes and storage methods for: geothermal energy, biological and liquid fuels, wave energy, and photovoltaic. In addition the book will cover renewable energy conversions for powering small electrics, as well as battery applications for portable power, and energy bands in semiconductors","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:edf7c89d4d9117cda11eae72a52987177670048c","amp;dn":"Renewable+Energy+Conversion%2CTransmission+and+Storage","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"edf7c89d4d9117cda11eae72a52987177670048c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,247,200,157,77,145,23,205,161,30,174,114,165,41,135,23,118,112,4,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
