The touring band included Bobby Keys, Chuck Leavell, Lisa Fischer, Cindy Mizelle, Bernard Fowler, Matt Clifford and the Uptown Horns. The Steel Wheels/ Urban Jungle tour became the highest grossing tour of all time. But itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not just the figures that set this show apart from others, the Rolling Stones revisited songs from their psychedelic period such as Ã¢â‚¬Å“2000 Light Years From HomeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ruby TuesdayÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, with cosmic results. In 2012 Bob Clearmountain applied the mix.\n\nTracklisting [320k MP3]\n\n01 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Start Me Up\n02 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Bitch\n03 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Sad Sad Sad\n04 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Harlem Shuffle\n05 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Tumbling Dice\n06 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Miss You\n07 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ruby Tuesday\n08 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Almost Hear You Sigh\n09 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Rock And A Hard Place\n10 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Mixed Emotions\n11 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Honky Tonk Women\n12 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Midnight Rambler\n13 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ You CanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Always Get What You Want\n14 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ CanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Be Seen\n15 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Happy\n16 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Paint It Black\n17 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2000 Light Years From Home\n18 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Sympathy For The Devil\n19 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Gimme Shelter\n20 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Band Introductions\n21 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Only Rock Ã¢â‚¬Ëœn Roll\n22 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Brown Sugar\n23 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ (I CanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Get No) Satisfaction\n24 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Jumping Jack Flash","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7971de7cf9208d2dbf011b726daafc3cc981f33a","amp;dn":"The+Rolling+Stones+-+LIVE+Tokyo+Dome+1990+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7971de7cf9208d2dbf011b726daafc3cc981f33a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,113,222,124,249,32,141,45,191,1,27,114,109,170,252,60,201,129,243,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
