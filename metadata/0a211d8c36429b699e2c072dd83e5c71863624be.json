Yes, and no. Yes, because some listeners need to hear that song again and again as long as they live, and no, because this collection of love songs doesn&amp;#039;t really do much for the re-born Cyrus&amp;#039; reputation as a singer. There are good single titles here, like &quot;She&amp;#039;s Not Cryin&amp;#039; Anymore,&quot; which was actually the very best song on Some Gave All, the album that contained the aforementioned abomination. Other tracks such as &quot;I Am Here Now,&quot; from Trail of Tears, and the title cut off It Won&amp;#039;t Be the Last, also work quite well. The reason? Cyrus co-wrote these songs; he wasn&amp;#039;t interpreting them. There&amp;#039;s real heart in his performances. Some of the others included here, &quot;Only God Could Stop Me Loving You,&quot; from Storm in the Heartland, and &quot;Missing You,&quot; from &quot;Shot Full of Love,&quot; are saccharine and flat. Lifeless. This may indeed be a production problem because Cyrus is capable of belting them when he wants to, with real soul as well as power. But three excellent songs a love song collection does not make. ~ Thom Jurek, All Music Guide\n\n\nInformation Disc:\n\n? Artist:  Billy Ray Cyrus\n? Title:   Love Songs\n? Year:    2008\n?
