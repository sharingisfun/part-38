At the center of Special Topics in Calamity Physics is clever, deadpan Blue van Meer, who has a head full of literary, philosophical, scientific, and cinematic knowledge. But she could use some friends. Upon entering the elite St. Gallway School, she finds someÃ¢â‚¬â€a clique of eccentrics known as the Bluebloods. One drowning and one hanging later, Blue finds herself puzzling out a byzantine murder mystery. Nabokov meets Donna Tartt (then invites the rest of the Western Canon to the party) in this novelÃ¢â‚¬â€with visual aids drawn by the authorÃ¢â‚¬â€that has won over readers of all ages.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d31fee4a7065f9482e8b8f5caa8a1a32bda83a97","amp;dn":"Marisha+Pessl+-+Special+Topics+in+Calamity+Physics","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d31fee4a7065f9482e8b8f5caa8a1a32bda83a97","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,31,238,74,112,101,249,72,46,139,143,92,170,138,26,50,189,168,58,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
