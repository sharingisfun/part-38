The effects of the immense waves were felt as far away as France. Barometers in BogotÃƒÂ¡ and Washington, D.C., went haywire. Bodies were washed up in Zanzibar. The sound of the island's destruction was heard in Australia and India and on islands thousands of miles away. Most significant of all -- in view of today's new political climate -- the eruption helped to trigger in Java a wave of murderous anti-Western militancy among fundamentalist Muslims, one of the first outbreaks of Islamic-inspired killings anywhere. Krakatoa gives us an entirely new perspective on this fascinating and iconic event.\n\nThis P.S. edition features an extra 16 pages of insights into the book, including author interviews, recommended reading, and more","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4e7fb4f17b662beeee1c5fc1995e778d39a22a5","amp;dn":"Krakatoa+-+The+Day+the+World+Exploded%3A+August+27%2C+1883","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c4e7fb4f17b662beeee1c5fc1995e778d39a22a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,231,251,79,23,182,98,190,238,225,197,252,25,149,231,120,211,154,34,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
