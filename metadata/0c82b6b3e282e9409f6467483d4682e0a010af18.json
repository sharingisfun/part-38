The songs that make up her new release deal with relationships, both earthly (person-to-person) and spiritual (person-to-God). Stylistically HellerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s music falls into a singer songwriter meets acoustic folk rock style with her beautifully sounding vocals driving the music. The songs alternate between melodic with flowing strings to mid-tempo with an almost pop edge to them at times.\n\n01. Tell It Again - 2:45\n02. When I'm With You - 2:47\n03.
