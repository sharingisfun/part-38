Celestial RuinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sound combines heavy rock rhythms and riffs with catchy, singable melodies, and rich symphonic textures. The combination is Ã¢â‚¬Å“epicÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ by all accounts. Lyrical themes are drawn from fantasy and horror, sometimes implying deeper meanings, sometimes just celebrating the subject matter. \n\nCelestial RuinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s live performance is close to the recording but organically so. They shun the use of backing tracks and drum machines, performing every aspect of the music live. Their music is written as organically as it is performed, a completely collaborative effort on the part of all project members.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.celestialruin.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.celestialruin.com/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f62151f696a8a01db9281d6a7239ef18b588df3","amp;dn":"Celestial+Ruin+-+Awakening%2B%2B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f62151f696a8a01db9281d6a7239ef18b588df3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,98,21,31,105,106,138,1,219,146,129,214,167,35,158,241,139,88,141,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
