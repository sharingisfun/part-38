Food Colloids: Self-Assembly and Material Science describes new developments in the theory and practice of the formulation of food emulsions, dispersions, gels and foams. Particular emphasis is placed on the self-assembly of surfactants and biopolymers in food. Topics include: colloid science in food nutrition and the relationship of texture to sensory perception of food materials. It also discusses the exploitation of surfactant mesophases for nanoscale encapsulation, the interfacial rheological properties of mixed interfaces, the dynamics and microrheology of gels and emulsions, the stability of droplets and bubbles, the effects of thermal and mechanical processing on food colloid stability and the electrostatic interactions of proteins with polysaccharides. This authoritative book will serve as a guide and reference to researchers in the field of food colloids","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:09b30d555b1e9d7d07e76bb91b3fb5a695d36be0","amp;dn":"Food+Colloids+-+Self-Assembly+and+Material+Science","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"09b30d555b1e9d7d07e76bb91b3fb5a695d36be0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,179,13,85,91,30,157,125,7,231,107,185,27,63,181,166,149,211,107,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
