He lives in Milan; she, in Melbourne. For the past four years, they have glimpsed each other at random moments, while they are both unconscious Ã¢â‚¬â€ a telepathic communication that occurs without warning.\n\nDuring one of these episodes, they manage to arrange a meeting. But on the day, though they are standing in the same place at the same time, each of them cannot see the other. This leads them to a startling discovery: they live in different dimensions. In Jenny's world, Alex is someone else. And in Alex's world, Jenny died at the age of six.\n\nAs they try to find each other, the Multiverse threatens to implode and disappear, but Jenny and Alex must meet Ã¢â‚¬â€ the future of the Earth depends on it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:99f2187469bb4b8b6de2fe9153ed5fc2a209383a","amp;dn":"Leonardo+Patrignani+-+Multiversum+%28retail%29.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"99f2187469bb4b8b6de2fe9153ed5fc2a209383a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,242,24,116,105,187,75,139,109,226,254,145,83,237,95,194,162,9,56,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
