Released in 1987, Marx became the first solo artist in recording history to reach the top three of the Billboard Hot 100 with four singles from a debut album, including his first number one Pop single &quot;Hold On to the Nights&quot; in mid-1988. The album's first single &quot;Don't Mean Nothing' charted at number one on Billboard's Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart in 1987.\n\nRichard Noel Marx (born September 16, 1963 in Chicago, Illinois) is an American adult contemporary and pop/rock singer, songwriter, musician, and record producer. He had a string of hit singles in the late 1980s and 1990s, including &quot;Endless Summer Nights&quot;, &quot;Right Here Waiting&quot;, &quot;Now and Forever&quot;, and &quot;Hazard&quot;. Although most of his major hit songs were slow ballads, many of his songs had a classic rock style, such as &quot;Don't Mean Nothing,&quot; &quot;Should've Known Better,&quot; &quot;Satisfied,&quot; and &quot;Too Late To Say Goodbye&quot;. Marx placed himself in the record books by being the first solo artist to have his first seven singles hit the Top 5 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart (3, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 4). His record sales worldwide exceed 30 million.\n\nMarx's self-titled debut album, released in June 1987, yielded four hit singles and sold nearly four million copies in the US. The debut single, &quot;Don't Mean Nothing&quot;, had been released the previous month and climbed to #3 on the Billboard Hot 100 as well as #1 on Billboard's Album Rock charts. Marx became the first new artist played on 117 radio stations nationwide during his initial week on the charts. The next two singles, &quot;ShouldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve Known Better&quot; and &quot;Endless Summer Nights&quot; reached #3 and #2, respectively. The fourth single release, &quot;Hold on to the Nights&quot;, earned Marx his first #1 Pop single.\n\nWith the success of his self-titled album, Marx became the first male artist to reach the Top 3 with four singles from a debut album. He embarked on his first world tour, initially opening for REO Speedwagon, but quickly began headlining his own shows. Marx's first tour kept him on the road for 14 months while the album remained on the charts for more than a year and a half.\n\nIn 1988, Marx was nominated for a Grammy Award for 'Best Rock Vocal Performance - Male' for &quot;DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Mean Nothing&quot; \n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f77bc020e1b058f17d2e8520cbc3bf86595602cd","amp;dn":"Richard+Marx+-+Should%5C%27ve+Known+Better++%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f77bc020e1b058f17d2e8520cbc3bf86595602cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,123,192,32,225,176,88,241,125,46,133,32,203,195,191,134,89,86,2,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
