These maps are, however, only usable in multiplayer and Instant Action play; you can't use them in the single-player campaign.\n\nYou will need a playable version of Mechwarrior 4: Mercenaries to use these maps, although any version from PR1 on should work just fine.  This torrent also contains NONE of the game files.  You can find a working install many places, or you can download a full version of .0030c (the last version of the MekTek Free Release version) at: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9771883, if you care to.\n\nEnjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a60268c5cc764a32291cec4c9e8628ce1ee8609","amp;dn":"MW4+Mercs+Super+Map+Pack+Collection+%28works+with+any+version+of+M","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a60268c5cc764a32291cec4c9e8628ce1ee8609","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,96,38,140,92,199,100,163,34,145,206,196,201,232,98,140,225,238,134,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
