Codemasters has secured from Majesco Sales Inc the European publishing rights to Raven SoftwareÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s 18-rated classic. With the atmosphere of a blockbuster action-thriller, Soldier of Fortune ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Gold plunges the player into a no-holds-barred modern day scenario. As John Mullins, the world\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s deadliest soldier of fortune, track down and take out a fanatical terrorist organisation with force.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Soldier of Fortune ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Gold submerses Mullins in the deadly world of a gun-for-hire with covert missions spanning five continents. The gameÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s 10 covert missions, covering 26 levels of play, take in the underworlds of political hotspots across the globe. As Mullins engages in sabotage, stealthy assassination, and full frontal assaults, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the playerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s skill as a clear-headed marksman that separates the hunter from becoming the hunted.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Mullins has access to lethal weaponry including a sniper rifle, grenades, plastic explosives and prototype pulse guns. Real bullets do real damage; shoot someone in the leg and he falls, writhing and grasping his wound. Shoot someone in the head and he falls down dead. The detailed enemy characters have hit points all over their bodies; take aim and fire ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ whether an opponent is left floored or terminated outright is up to you.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Powered by RavenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s GHOUL rendering system, the game displays unprecedented detail and realism in its creation of locations and character model animation.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ For the player who could do with some target practice before setting off, the game also includes a tutorial option.\n\nCompression type: .7zip Ultra\nCompressed Size: 270 MB\nUncompressed size: 748 MB\nMedia Type: DVD\nImage Format: .ISO\nRegion: NTSC","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a00815549ac3ee8cd06a2b94af0d1e8039d0594f","amp;dn":"%28PS2%29+Soldier+of+Fortune%3A+Gold+Edition+%28NTSC-U%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a00815549ac3ee8cd06a2b94af0d1e8039d0594f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,8,21,84,154,195,238,140,208,106,43,148,175,13,30,128,57,208,89,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
