The book is intended for a wide range of readers from undergraduates, postgraduates to senior scientists and engineers. In order to update the latest status of rechargeable batteries and predict near research trend, we plan to invite the world leading researchers who are presently working in the field to write each chapter of the book. The book covers not only lithium-ion batteries but also other batteries beyond lithium-ion, such as lithium-air, lithium-sulfur, sodium-ion, sodium-sulfur, magnesium-ion and liquid flow batteries","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f63b15ee391a7bbb72dd11c23d1c602116ed047e","amp;dn":"Rechargeable+Batteries+-+Materials%2C+Technologies+and+New+Trends","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f63b15ee391a7bbb72dd11c23d1c602116ed047e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,59,21,238,57,26,123,187,114,221,17,194,61,28,96,33,22,237,4,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
