According to rock lore they signed some &quot;lousy deal&quot; losing not only the \n\nrights to the TURTLES name but to their own names as well. \n\nAppropriating the names of 2 roadies they then became known as The Phlorescent Leech\n\nand Eddie so that others could communicate with them and not risk a law suit.\n\n\nAfter working with Zappa on the CHUNGA'S REVENGE LP and the movie 200 MOTELS\n\nthey were never quite the same musically and perhaps otherwise.  \n\n\nThis upload consists of vinyl rips from several FLO and EDDIE albums and CD rips of\n\nTURTLES hits interspersed.  IT'S MUSICAL COMEDY but the music stands alone as \n\ngood IMO.\n\n\nThere is some potentially offensive material here....Sue me only if you must.  Tell\n\nmy lawyer to drop dead and THEN bill me.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b4ea8a6383914c1c4144c6793463557a992ce686","amp;dn":"FLO+and+EDDIE+%2F+Turtles+compilation+%281965-76%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b4ea8a6383914c1c4144c6793463557a992ce686","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,234,138,99,131,145,76,28,65,68,198,121,52,99,85,122,153,44,230,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
