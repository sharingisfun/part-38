Mikey was a loyal friend but even he knew that Johnny was headed for bigger things. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s why he dubbed him the Mayor of Lexington Avenue.\n \nThe two friends were inseparableÃ¢â‚¬â€until one fateful night set them on their different paths: Johnny to life as a  high-powered lawyer in Miami, and Mikey to a shattered existence behind bars. Now, haunted by guilt over MikeyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s conviction, and numbed by the excesses of a successful life, Johnny finds his one last shot at redemption: A young Florida man is framed for a murder he didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t commit, and Johnny feels compelled to fight for himÃ¢â‚¬â€and, in a way, for Mikey. But there are powerful people who want the truth hidden, and Johnny will have to risk everything, and everyone, he cares about to save the young manÃ¢â‚¬Â¦and himself.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f2a9e59ddef4c3ba016dd4cc0616a300d11e4535","amp;dn":"James+Sheehan-The+Mayor+of+Lexington+Avenue+%28Mobi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f2a9e59ddef4c3ba016dd4cc0616a300d11e4535","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,169,229,157,222,244,195,186,1,109,212,204,6,22,163,0,209,30,69,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
