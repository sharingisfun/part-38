It is about secret societies, how they have directed the course of civilization and how they influence your life today. Most people don't realize they exist because their minds have been conditioned to reject any thought of such organizations. In this book, Dr. Monteith reveals the amazing facts he discovered in his almost 40 years of research. He reveals the identity of the mysterious forces behind the men who rule the world and why some of our leaders have dedicated their lives to destroying our nation. After reading Brotherhood of Darkness you will never look at the world the same way again","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c1271b10d46bddce6736e030cf22d3c487b6dcb0","amp;dn":"Brotherhood+Of+Darkness","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c1271b10d46bddce6736e030cf22d3c487b6dcb0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,39,27,16,212,107,221,206,103,54,224,48,207,34,211,196,135,182,220,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
