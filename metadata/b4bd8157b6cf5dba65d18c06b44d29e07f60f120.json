Its not a long movie, so the 1.8GB goes a long way indeed.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050083/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050083/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n12 Angry men is one of the most important courtroom/jury room dramas ever to\ncome out of the United states. The question presented to us in this great movie\nofferings is this: Is there justice in the level of discourse that is being \noffered. Is the articulation on the issues in fact valid or is it semantic like\nargument on feigns of dubious validity. If a case appears as it should: &quot;open and \nshut&quot; - is that reason enough to start to discount it? Should you decide that \neverything that could go the other way hypothetically, no matter how remote the \npossibility, that should be the order of the day of a particular brand of &quot;more\npure&quot; justice? Should the prejudices carried by members of the jury or testifying \nwitnesses be reason enough to negate and retard their testimony? should they be \nrequired as jury members to vote the other side instead? The OJ Simpson criminal\ntrial contained all of these elements in the minds of those who assembled not too \nlong ago on a PBS panel inquiry headed by talk show host Mr. Charlie Rose. The \nownership of property in and of itself should never be sufficient qualification to \nsit on a jury to decide the fate of members of the community. Instead, a sound \ngrounding in values that are humanistically pure and demonstrably so, combined \nwith sound reasoning skills and experience in the proper and right application of \nlegal principles that come from this sound philosophical basis should rule, and be \nthe requirement. So a panel of judges perhaps, appointed on more than their \nconnections within legal circles as it presently is comprised, rather on an open \ncontest in which real votes for merit may be clearly exercised in the protection \nof all. \n\nOtherwise, we could someday die for no other reason than a lack of restraint in \nthe environment caused by a complete breakdown in the expectation of justice based \non jury members that are nothing more than proxies for those that would inflict \ntheir own brand of justice instead. The OJ Simspon affair should raise just such \nalarm bells as the second trial rightly pointed out, however it came too late to \nimpose penalties to fit the crime - financial constraints that were imposed \nsubsequently on the defendant could hardly be deemed sane enough for anyone that \nwas looking in at the situation in objective fashion unable to do nothing but \n&quot;shake their heads&quot; in amazement that this could go on without a public scream \nthat should never end until the righter outcome is seen through instead.\n\n\nMichael Rizzo Chessman\n\n\nWe will try to have as many subtitle offerings (in the coming weeks)in various\nlanguages to include German French Polish Romanian Greek Italian Norwegian \nSwedish Dutch Finnish, Danish, Spanish and any other Euro languages we might\nexpect to find.\n\nWe do have lots of subs for the PAL/NTSC DVD versions as they turned out to be\nthe same. We now will be on the lookout for bluray version subs, if you have\nthem to post please do so for the benefit of all the community here. Thanks indeed!\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b4bd8157b6cf5dba65d18c06b44d29e07f60f120","amp;dn":"12+Angry+Men+%282GB+DivX++720p+HD%29+moviesbyrizzo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b4bd8157b6cf5dba65d18c06b44d29e07f60f120","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,189,129,87,182,207,93,186,101,209,140,6,180,77,41,224,127,96,241,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
