And when the distortion is impossible to avoid, the program makes the sound affable to human hearing. This solution is tipically used by analogous technologies. Important: do not put the program at the end of the effect chain, the last must always be a limiter!\n\n\nMinimum System Requirements:\nIntel Pentium Celeron 1800 1024 Mb Ram.
