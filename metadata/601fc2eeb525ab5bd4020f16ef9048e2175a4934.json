Early that December, they added drummer Bob Murray, and in January 1979, guitarist Randy Franklin completed the lineup. \n\nBy spring 1979, they were getting opening slots at the Armadillo World Headquarters for John Cale and Joe Jackson, and in July, they won the Texas New Wave Battle of the Bands at Dallas' Palladium. In September, they self-released a three-song EP, Early Warning, one of the first records to come out of Austin's punk/New Wave movement and one of the best in terms of recording quality. A high school friend of Seaman's, Roland Swenson, was managing the band by now, and a gig opening for Blondie in Houston landed them a role as the punk band Spittle in \u0010Alan Rudolph's film Roadie, which was partially filmed in and around Austin. The end of the year saw them included (with the Explosions, Skunks, Terminal Mind, and the Next) on the Live at Raul's compilation with two songs. A second self-released record, a single of &quot;Don't Worry&quot; b/w &quot;Integrating Circuits,&quot; came out in March 1980, and the band headed to New York City for the first time. \n\nThey were well received, enough so that Seaman and Lay later decided that New York would be a good move, since Austin was taking the band for granted. Franklin didn't want to relocate and left the band on New Year's Eve. The two remaining Waves (Murray had also quit) recruited two Oklahomans, Bruce Henderson (bass, vocals) and David Dage (drums) and played a few gigs in Austin before moving to New York to a fifth-floor walkup apartment on West 43rd St. They continued to tour, and built up some national support. They were regulars at CBGB and Maxwell, and eventually were approached by Warner Bros. A&amp;R woman Karen Berg. During sessions for the demo, the band began to fight and eventually broke up. All except Henderson eventually returned to Austin, and all went on to other music projects. Dage died in 2003. The original band now reunites semi-regularly and occasionally records.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ed Ward\n\nFacebook:\n\nTRACK LIST:\nA1 Vertigo 3:59\t\nA2 Crash And Burn 3:07\nA3 Can't Let Go 4:18\nB1 Behavior Mod\t2:54\nB2 Sensory Overload 4:17\nB3 Never Say Die 3:31\n\nCREDITS\nBass, Vocals Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Bruce Henderson\nDrums, Percussion, Vocals Ã¢â‚¬â€œ David Dage\nEngineer Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ju Wray\nExecutive Producer Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Roland Swenson\nGuitar, Vocals Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Larry Seaman\nKeyboards Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Shona Lay\nProducer Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Patrick S.
