Spending time in her fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s music stall in Brixton Market, her musical education began. Informed by producers like Brian Eno and Quincy Jones, her influences grew to include everyone from Siouxie Soux, PiL and The Slits to Public Enemy and Fela Kuti.. Armed with her own mature and captivating sound and a strong DIY ethic, EbonyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sophomore album, Behold, A Pale Horse, will be released in August via 1984 Records.\n\n\nTracklisting\n\n\n1.
