Believing her to be a divine presence, Miyatsuko and his wife decide to raise her as their own, calling her &quot;Princess&quot;. The girl grows rapidly and conspicuously, marveling her parents and earning her the nickname &quot;Takenoko&quot; (Little Bamboo) from the other children in the village. Sutemaru, the oldest among Kaguya's friends, develops a particularly close relationship with her.\r\n\r\nMiyatsuko comes upon gold and fine cloth in the bamboo grove in the same way he found his daughter. He takes these as proof of her divine royalty and begins planning to make her a proper princess. He soon relocates the family to the capital, forcing her to leave her friends behind. She finds herself in a mansion, replete with servants and fine clothes. She is also saddled with a governess who is tasked with taming her into a proper noblewoman. She struggles with the restraints of nobility, arguing that life should be full of laughter and struggle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Info\r\n\r\n\r\nCompression: No\r\nMovie Quality: DVD9\r\nSize: 8247 Mb\r\nRuntiime: 131 min.\r\nLanguages: Italian, Japanese Ac3 5.1\r\nSubtitles: Italian\r\nExtra: End press conference processing, Trailer &amp; Spot, Credits\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt2576852/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:83e048266f4f324c1690246db8b07dc4f8ec64f4","amp;dn":"The+Tale+of+Princess+Kaguya+-+La+Storia+della+Principessa+Splend","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"83e048266f4f324c1690246db8b07dc4f8ec64f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,224,72,38,111,79,50,76,22,144,36,109,184,176,125,196,248,236,100,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
