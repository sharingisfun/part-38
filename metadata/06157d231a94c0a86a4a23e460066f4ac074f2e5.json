Exile\n\nSteve Reynolds' freshman set &quot;Exile&quot; is a good collection of folk-flavored tracks. His voice most reminds me of Steve Forbert, expressive with just a hint of a rasp to give character. The band gives his songs excellent backing. &quot;Dear Rose&quot; is an excellent track with Reynolds' finger-style guitar starting the track as a folk melody before the band breaks into the Springsteen-like booming chorus, &quot;My load got light, Heroes for a time, Dear Rose for life.&quot; &quot;That Old Love&quot; has a lovely melody with Reynolds painting sonically &amp; lyrically, &quot;Could you bring back that old love so I can stay awhile?&quot; &quot;Miner's Lamp&quot; is another strong track with minimal acoustic backing allowing Reynolds' voice to paint a tale of loss, &quot;What lays in the woods is just the memory of a scream, the creek runs on but you're lost in this dream.&quot; &quot;Painter &amp; Son&quot; has a simple but beautiful melody with an instrumental build and Reynolds' vocals somewhere between James Blunt and Nick Drake. The CD concludes with the title track, &quot;Nowhere now, this ain't no place I know; Closer now to where it is I want to go.&quot; &quot;Exile&quot; is a good solid folk-pop effort by a promising musician. Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:06157d231a94c0a86a4a23e460066f4ac074f2e5","amp;dn":"Steve+Reynolds+-+Exile+%5B2005%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"06157d231a94c0a86a4a23e460066f4ac074f2e5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,21,125,35,26,148,192,168,106,74,35,228,96,6,111,74,192,116,242,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
