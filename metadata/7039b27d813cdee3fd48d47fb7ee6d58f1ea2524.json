In so doing he considers virtually all aspects of ribosome structure and function\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7039b27d813cdee3fd48d47fb7ee6d58f1ea2524","amp;dn":"Protein+Synthesis+and+Ribosome+Structure","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7039b27d813cdee3fd48d47fb7ee6d58f1ea2524","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,57,178,125,129,60,222,227,253,72,212,127,183,238,109,88,241,234,37,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
