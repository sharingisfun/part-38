They turn it into a cozy writer's retreat with a compact kitchen and completely renovated bathroom. Meanwhile, the Young Guns win a burned out house for a dollar because no one else wants it. But Cousin Casey won't move it and Cody enlists Randy to do the job for half the profits. The Young Guns use some clever cost saving tricks to take this horror house with no functioning kitchen nor bathroom and transform it into a cute little cottage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal Air Date: 30-Oct-2015","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba29f1bf3e643d4027aa8231876bebbcbb9265f1","amp;dn":"Texas+Flip+and+Move+S02E07+A+Dollar+Deal+vs+The+Retreat+PDTV.x26","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba29f1bf3e643d4027aa8231876bebbcbb9265f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,41,241,191,62,100,61,64,39,170,130,49,135,107,235,188,187,146,101,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
