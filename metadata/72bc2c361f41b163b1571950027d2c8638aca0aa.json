Sturges was always fascinated with the saga of W.T.G. Morton, the 19th century Boston dentist who, after inventing the first truly effective anesthesia, was forced to give up his proprietary interest in the invention and ended up dying in poverty and obscurity. Joel McCrea stars as Morton, a young oral surgeon determined to find a painless method for exracting teeth-which he does, virtually by accident. Betty Field costars as Morton's faithful spouse Elizabeth, while Sturges regular William Demarest offers a gem of a performance as Morton's best friend-guinea pig Eben Frost (his persistence upon recalling his first meeting with Morton -- &quot;I was in excru-ci-ating pain&quot;-is one of the film's highlights). Completed in 1942, The Great Moment was taken out of Sturges' hands and heavily re-edited and re-arranged by the Paramount executives: as a result, the story is confusing and downright incomprehensible at times (the film's present ending, for example, originally occured in the middle of the film). The result was varying runtimes for the film of 80, 83, 87, and 90 minutes. An enormous box-office flop in 1944, the film proved to be the beginning of the end for Sturges, who was never able to completely recover from its failure. \n\n   General\n      Complete name : The Great Moment.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      File size : 1.09 GiB\n      Duration : 1h 21mn\n      Overall bit rate : 1 930 Kbps\n      Writing application : FairUse Wizard - http://fairusewizard.com\n      Writing library : The best and REALLY easy backup tool\n   Video #0\n      ID : 0\n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format profile : AdvancedSimple@L5\n      Format settings, BVOP : Yes\n      Format settings, QPel : No\n      Format settings, GMC : No warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Default (MPEG)\n      Muxing mode : Packed bitstream\n      Codec ID : XVID\n      Codec ID/Hint : XviD\n      Duration : 1h 21mn\n      Bit rate : 1 728 Kbps\n      Width : 640 pixels\n      Height : 464 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 1.379\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.243\n      Stream size : 1 001 MiB (90%)\n      Writing library : XviD 1.2.1 (UTC 2008-12-04)\n   Audio #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : AC-3\n      Format/Info : Audio Coding 3\n      Codec ID : 2000\n      Duration : 1h 21mn\n      Bit rate mode : Constant\n      Bit rate : 192 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Channel positions : L R\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Stream size : 111 MiB (10%)\n      Alignment : Split accross interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 42 ms (1.00 video frame)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 500 ms\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0036880/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0036880/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEnglish audio; Multilanguage subpack (English, French and Spanish)\n\nPreston Sturges - The Great Moment (1944)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:72bc2c361f41b163b1571950027d2c8638aca0aa","amp;dn":"Preston+Sturges+-+The+Great+Moment+%281944%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"72bc2c361f41b163b1571950027d2c8638aca0aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,188,44,54,31,65,177,99,177,87,25,80,2,125,44,134,56,172,160,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
