The difficult thing is to know what needs improving, and then whether your interventions have made a positive difference. This course provides an overview of the basic tools used for process improvement, such as statistical process control, and how to use these tools to improve the three most critical aspects of your business process: time, quality, and cost. Chris Croft distills the best practices from process improvement frameworks such as Lean and Six Sigma, and combines them into lessons that will help take the core of what your business does, measure it, and do it better.â€¨â€¨This course qualifies for 1.5 Category A professional development units (PDUs) through Lynda.com, PMI Registered Education Provider #4101.â€¨\r\nTopics include:\r\n\tâ€¢\tMeasuring processes\r\n\tâ€¢\tUsing statistical process control\r\n\tâ€¢\tOptimizing the quality, cost, and time trade-off\r\n\tâ€¢\tUnderstanding queues\r\n\tâ€¢\tReducing cost by reducing waste\r\n\tâ€¢\tImproving delivery time\r\n\tâ€¢\tThinking about batch sizes\r\n\tâ€¢\tUnderstanding Lean and Six Sigma processes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d113afa297593ced8c133a5e210c40e17bc19f01","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+Process+Improvement+Fundamentals","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d113afa297593ced8c133a5e210c40e17bc19f01","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,19,175,162,151,89,60,237,140,19,58,94,33,12,64,225,123,193,159,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
