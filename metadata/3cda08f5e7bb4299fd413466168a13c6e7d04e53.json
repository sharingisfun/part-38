They have been doing this from behind the scenes for a few centuries now. In future, they want to do it openly, without fear of retribution. To that end, their lackeys led by the Rockefellers are spearheading a movement for a global government. The goal is a smaller world population under the absolute dictatorship of a chosen elite. In this book, you will learn how this global dictatorship is being slowly brought into place, often with the unwitting support of the slaves themselves. \n\nToo good to be true? Skip over to the Appendix and read the full text of Icarus, or The Future Of Science. In that 1924 book, Marxist philosopher Bertrand Russell has almost outlined the plan for the Rothschild World Government.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3cda08f5e7bb4299fd413466168a13c6e7d04e53","amp;dn":"World+Government+Slave+Handbook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3cda08f5e7bb4299fd413466168a13c6e7d04e53","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,218,8,245,231,187,66,153,253,65,52,102,22,138,19,198,231,208,78,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
