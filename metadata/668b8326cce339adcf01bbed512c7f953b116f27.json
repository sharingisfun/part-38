Readers will witness Jackson's campaign to recharge his career - hiring and firing managers and advisors, turning to and away from family members, fighting depression and drug dependency - while his one goal remained: to mount the most spectacular series of shows the world had ever seen.\r\n\r\nBEFORE YOU JUDGE ME is a humanizing look at Jackson's last days","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:668b8326cce339adcf01bbed512c7f953b116f27","amp;dn":"Before+You+Judge+Me+-+The+Triumph+and+Tragedy+of+Michael+Jackson","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"668b8326cce339adcf01bbed512c7f953b116f27","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,139,131,38,204,227,57,173,207,1,187,237,81,44,127,149,59,17,111,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
