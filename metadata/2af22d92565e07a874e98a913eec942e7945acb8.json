Featuring 20-bit remastering from the original analog tapes, exact replicas of the original artwork and liner notes, previously unreleased cuts, and additional liner notes, this installment of Vanguard's Original Master Series is a historic collection of contemporary and traditional folk. Though Baez was reportedly suffering from stage fright at the time of these recordings, which were cobbled from the fall of 1961 to the spring of 1962, her delivery is crystal clear and confident. The exhaustive selection of material represents her diverse influences, most notably African tradition (&quot;Kumbaya&quot;), gospel (&quot;Gospel Ship&quot;), negro spiritual (&quot;My Lord What a Morning&quot;), West African (&quot;Danger Waters&quot;), Brazilian (&quot;Ate Amanha,&quot; which is sung in Portuguese), and blues (&quot;Babe I'm Gonna Leave You&quot;), Baez's performances still retain freshness and vitality after four decades.\n\nTracklisting:\n1.
