It contains IntelÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® Matrix Storage Manager slipstreamed, in order to be used transparently with Intel SATA controllers (laptops, etc). It requires no serial to be entered and it has unattended and undisturbing behavior during installation. Several useful settings that differ from the defaults have been applied using nLite, so please do not use it if you are seeking for a &quot;default&quot;, traditional installation.\nSetup creates only one user (&quot;Administrator&quot;), with password: 12345\nThe release is English, but &quot;Greek optimized&quot;. If you want to have Greek interface as well, you have to install the &quot;MUI Greek Pack&quot; included in the &quot;AddOns&quot; folder in the CD.\n\n************************\nBUG FIX PROCEDURE:\nDuring setup, two input (keyboard) languages (English, Greek) are being installed automatically. Due to an nLite bug, the Greek language installation is incorrect. This has nothing to do with the Greek user interface, it only refers to input (keyboard) language. In order to fix it you must reinstall the Greek language as soon as the setup finishes. To do this you must follow these easy steps:\n\n1. Go to [Start]=&gt;[Settings]=&gt;[Control Panel].\n2. Double-click [Regional and Language Options].\n3. Go to the [Languages] tab, and then click [Details] under &quot;Text Services and Input Languages&quot;.\n4. Click on the Greek language under &quot;Installed Services&quot;, then click [Remove].\n5. Click [Add], then click on the Greek language and the Greek keyboard layout and press OK.\n************************\n\nAdditional features included (&quot;AddOns&quot; folder in the CD):\n1. Greek Multi User Interface (MUI) pack\n2. Windows Media Player 11\n3. Key changer (an option for you to become legal, you never know...)\n4. TweakUI\n5. 7Zip\n6.
