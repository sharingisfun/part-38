Set in\nthe village of Carhill Scotland, in the heart of the\nFife coalfields, we follow the journey of one mining\ncommunity as they are pushed inevitably towards a\nlabour conflict with the Kingdom Coal Company in a\nseven month long lock out. &quot;Not a penny off the pay,\nnot a minute on the day&quot; is the chant as the coal\ncompany demand longer hours for less pay.\n\nThe intimate portrayal of three families show the human\nconsequences of an impersonal economics. The coal company\npractically owns the village and is colluding with\ngovernment forces to keep the 'red threat' under control.\nStanding up for their rights inspires national support\nand galvanizes a defiant spirit of the time. Faith forged\nthrough suffering grows and though the strike fails, the\nseed of a political awakening is sown.\n\nInspired by true stories from local families in Fife, the\nHappy Lands follows the journey of law-abiding citizens who\nbecome law-breakers in a heroic battle against the state.\nIt's never a good time to stand up for your rights - but\nit's always the right time.\n\nHappy Lands was developed and created along with the\nFife Mining community.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img19.imageshack.us/img19/7640/cy1f.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img19.imageshack.us/img19/7640/cy1f.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\nKevin Clarke ...
