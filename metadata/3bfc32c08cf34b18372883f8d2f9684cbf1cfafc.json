The edits were made hastily, and marred the look of the film.\nNow, after 40 years, fans can finally experience Brian De Palma's PHANTOM like never before.\nThis version utilizes the original footage salvaged by the Swan Archives, transfered from 35mm to HD and meticulously restored, and aims to present the film to the way we believe it had looked prior to these last-minute mutilations. All the deleted footage was enhanced and color-corrected to match the rest of the film. Some of the original audio and soundtrack cues that would have matched the deleted footage have never been found, and had to be recreated and mixed with the original 1974 stereo mix, preserved from a lossless source. By comparing this version to the theatrical release, we can see how the movie was (ironically, given the filmÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s story) disfigured against its creatorsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ wishes, to suit the whims of corporate rightsholders.\nThis unofficial HD recreation of the director's cut was restored for Brian De Palma, whose perfect film should have never been mutilated by those greaseballs.\n\nVideo : h264 | 640x360 | 1.85:1 A.R. | 23.976fps | 900 kb/s.\nAudio : English | original sound mix 2.0 | AAC 255k. \nRuntime : 01:33:08\nFormat : mp4\nSize : 770 mb\n\n* All the alternate footage in this new restoration is HD-sourced and untagged.\n* More info, screengrabs and direct download links on my blog.
