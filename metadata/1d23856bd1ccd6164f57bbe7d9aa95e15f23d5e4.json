Despite \nsome uncertainty and initial denials, on December 16, 2011 it was announced \nthat Brian Wilson, Mike Love, Al Jardine, Bruce Johnston and David Marks \nwould reunite for a new album and 50th anniversary tour in 2012 that would \ninclude a performance at the New Orleans Jazz Festival in April.\n\nThe first single from the album, &quot;That's Why God Made the Radio&quot; made its \nnational radio debut April 25, 2012 on ESPN's Mike and Mike in the Morning. It \nwas released to the bands YouTube channel later that same day, with \naccompanying lyrics. In addition the song has been released and is now \navailable as a single in digital outlets such as iTunes and Amazon.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d23856bd1ccd6164f57bbe7d9aa95e15f23d5e4","amp;dn":"The+Beach+Boys+-+That%27s+Why+God+Made+the+Radio+%28Single%29+2012","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d23856bd1ccd6164f57bbe7d9aa95e15f23d5e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,35,133,107,209,204,214,22,79,87,187,231,217,170,149,225,95,35,213,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
