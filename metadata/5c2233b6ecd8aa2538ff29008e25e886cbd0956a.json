It was released in 1988 as the third single from Poison&amp;#039;s second album Open Up And Say...Ahh!. It is the band&amp;#039;s first and only number-one hit in the U.S., reaching the top spot on Christmas Eve in 1988 for three weeks (carrying over into 1989). It was also a #13 hit in the UK. \n\nThe music video for this song is in the same vein as other videos for similar songs of the era. It features Michaels sitting down, playing the guitar, and singing along to the song, interspersed with black and white clips from concerts, and colour frames of what passes for a &amp;#039;storyline&amp;#039; that follows the song.\n\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c2233b6ecd8aa2538ff29008e25e886cbd0956a","amp;dn":"Poison+-+Every+Rose+Has+It%5C%27s+Thorn","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c2233b6ecd8aa2538ff29008e25e886cbd0956a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,34,51,182,236,216,170,37,56,255,41,0,142,37,232,134,203,208,149,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
