Rafferty was born into a working-class family in Paisley, Renfrewshire, Scotland. His mother taught him both Irish and Scottish folk songs as a boy; later, he was influenced by the music of The Beatles and Bob Dylan. He joined the folk-pop group The Humblebums in 1969. After they disbanded in 1971, he recorded his first solo album, Can I Have My Money Back? Rafferty and Joe Egan formed the group Stealers Wheel in 1972, producing several hits, most notably &quot;Stuck in the Middle with You&quot;. In 1978, he recorded his second solo album, City to City, which included &quot;Baker Street&quot;, his most popular song.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAnother World is the ninth and final studio album by Gerry Rafferty. The album was released in 2000 on the Icon Music label to good reviews. It was re-released in 2003 on the Hypertension label with a slightly amended track order, and with &quot;La Fenetre&quot; replaced by &quot;Keep It To Yourself&quot;, the latter track also being released a single in Europe and the UK. Mark Knopfler of Dire Straits appears throughout the album, providing rhythm guitar and lead fills.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGerry Rafferty: vocals, guitar, synthesizer bass, keyboards, production\n\nGiles Twigg: drums, percussion, programming, bass, effected guitar, engineering\n\nMel Collins: saxophone\n\nCindy Legall: background vocals\n\nBryn Haworth: electric &amp; slide guitar\n\nJulian Littman: guitar, accordion, background vocals\n\nHugh Burns: guitar\n\nKenny Craddock: keyboards\n\nDave Suttle: vocal percussion\n\nVic Linton: electric guitar\n\nMark Knopfler: electric guitar\n\nMo Foster: bass\n\nPino Palladino: bass\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:873bd3f6eb4ccb3e739d019ee08097955a81a98c","amp;dn":"Gerry+Rafferty+-+Another+World+%5B2003%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"873bd3f6eb4ccb3e739d019ee08097955a81a98c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,59,211,246,235,76,203,62,115,157,1,158,224,128,151,149,90,129,169,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
