Afterwards, Ion joined Infestum on vocals and Thorngrim joined on bass. With this line-up, Infestum started to create their music. They also played the songs of bands such as Sepultura, Mayhem, Venom, and Bathory at their rehearsals. In the winter of 2000-2001, Infestum recorded their first demo, which was called &quot;Infestum&quot; and contained five songs. The song &quot;Secha (Slashing)&quot; begins with sounds like a battle, horses galoping, axes, screams, and a martial rhythm. As Ion said in the interview to &quot;Eternal Hate&quot; webzine, &quot;Our history, battles of the past and battles in our minds are fundamental in our creation&quot;. Later in 2002, this record was released in an MCD format on the American label Battle Hymn Records. The demo release has received generally positive feedback in the press and has been compared with bands such as Bathory, Falkenbach, Gontyna Kry, Graveland, and Nordreich.\n\nIn spring 2001, Infestum started to play concerts actively. But in October the same year, Grond got injured and was not able to play in the band anymore. He was replaced by Burglar, who played in Morbid Victory at that time. Burglar left Morbid Victory and became an Infestum member. He participated in recording a full-length CD which the band were going to call &quot;Criteria of Pure Insanity&quot;, but later changed their mind. This title was given to the first song of the album.\n\nIn winter 2000-2001, Infestum recorded a full-length album, which was called &quot;Last Day Before the Endless Night&quot;. It had four re-recorded songs from the demo album, alongside newly introduced songs. During the end of 2002, the album was released by the Russian label More Hate Productions. Cover artwork and design was handled by Valdmar Smerdulak, an artist who has worked with such groups as Nanghizidda and Massive Carnage. Black metal was attenuated with instrumental compositions, which emphasized folklorish style of Infestum. But new lyrics was almost devoid of folk motives.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b85ea587db8e02d376914805e6dc5ff904917c30","amp;dn":"Infestum-Monuments+Of+Exalted++320k++mp3+++ak2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b85ea587db8e02d376914805e6dc5ff904917c30","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,94,165,135,219,142,2,211,118,145,72,5,230,220,95,249,4,145,124,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
