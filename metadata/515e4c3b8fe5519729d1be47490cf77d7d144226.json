Uniquely relevant, JeffersonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s influence was felt on almost every critical policy question facing the young Republic, and his rhetorical and political legacy is still very much alive and contested today. Yet Jefferson has still remained a largely enigmatic figure, one that is peculiarly hard to place in terms of character and core convictions. These twelve lectures will be devoted to trying to elicit some of those convictions and reveal some of the personality traits of one of AmericaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most remarkable statesmen and thinkers. The lectures will seek to understand Jefferson in his own words, viewing his beliefs in the context of his actions as well as the larger historical milieu. The goal will be to note development in JeffersonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s thinking and practice, as well as to identify his core beliefs.\n\nThe first two lectures are devoted to setting the context for JeffersonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s remarkable public career. His early childhood is examined as is his precocious intellectual development at the College of William and Mary. The second lecture details JeffersonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s philosophical beliefs, ranging from the metaphysical to the moral and aesthetic. We note the philosophically radical and eclectic nature of JeffersonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s thought and come to understand the foundational beliefs in nature and reason that informed his writing of the Declaration of Independence.\n\nThe next two lectures detail JeffersonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s early political career. Lecture Three examines his distinguished if unremunerative legal career and his experience as a radical member of the colonial legislature. We also examine his first foray into revolutionary writing in a pamphlet that would secure him national fame and his rhetorical genius is further examined in the Declaration of Independence. Lecture Four examines JeffersonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s proposed constitutional and legal reforms for Virginia, which suggest a mind in transition from traditional conservatism to enlightened radicalism. We conclude with an examination of JeffersonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s difficult tenure as wartime governor and the tragic death of his wife.\n\nLectures Five and Six examine the maturation of JeffersonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s political thought. Notes on the State of Virginia reveals a fundamental tension between the ideals of agrarianism and anti-slavery and the realities of early American society and racism. We follow JeffersonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s career abroad in lecture Six, and see a further exploration of the radical potential of his beliefs, as well as romantic engagements.\n\nLectures Seven through Nine focus on JeffersonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s critical role in the new nation, as Secretary of State, Vice President, and leader of the Republican opposition. Jeffersonian constitutional doctrines and partisan differences of this period are explored in some detail, as are the circumstances surrounding JeffersonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s eventual election to the presidency in 1800. His brilliant successes as President are detailed (e.g., cutting the federal deficit, shrinking the size of government, the Louisiana Purchase, cutting taxes, etc.) as well as his less successful ventures (the Burr prosecution, the Embargo of 1807-1809).\n\nThe final three lectures trace JeffersonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s life in retirement and offer some assessment of his overall career. Even in pastoral repose Jefferson was a whirlwind of activity, offering political advice, founding the University of Virginia, and leaving a remarkable literary legacy in his correspondence with his friend and rival, John Adams. The final lecture offers some speculations about the man behind the public persona, as well as the meaning of JeffersonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s legacy and career for Americans then and now.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nProfessor Recommend Links\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCondensed Bibliography \n\nThese selected titles from the reading list are now available on Amazon.com.
