Now, in the wars and intrigues that have cascaded from Charis's declaration of independence, the populous Republic of Siddermark is sliding into chaos. Vicar Clytahn of the Church of God at harvest time. King Cayleb of Charis, his queen Sharleyan, and Merlin Arthawes will have their hands full trying to stave off wholesale starvation in Siddermark while at the same time shipping in enough land combat units to fend off the &quot;volunteers&quot; from the Church's Temple Lands. And while Vicar Clyntahn is hailed in the Church for his boldness and audacity, there are those who remember how dependent Church power is on money from Siddermark...and who wonder what will happen if Siddermark starves. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:890d395ce3df30b8aae788ff5ab4c75e9d424417","amp;dn":"Safehold+Book+06+-+Midst+Toil+and+Tribulation","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"890d395ce3df30b8aae788ff5ab4c75e9d424417","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,13,57,92,227,223,48,184,170,231,136,255,90,180,199,94,157,66,68,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
