As a follow-up to One Direction's internationally successful debut album, Up All Night (2011), Take Me Home was written in groups and has an average of just under five songwriters per track. Largely recorded and composed in Sweden during 2012, Savan Kotecha, Rami Yacoub and Carl Falk, who composed One Direction's hits, &quot;What Makes You Beautiful&quot; and &quot;One Thing&quot;, spent six months in Stockholm developing songs for the album, and were able to shape melodies around the members' tones.\n\nTrack listing:-\n\n01.
