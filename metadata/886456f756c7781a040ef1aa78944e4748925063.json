This\n\nis one he led in 1957. \n\n\n\nYou can predict the quality of a record quite well oftentimes just from              \n\nnoting the names of the contributing musicians. Another Costa album; an album\n\nwith pianist Bill Evans is one I also need to get.\n\n\nTracks 2 and 6 are marked for frequent replay\n\n\nI love it when my ups aren't in the ACCURIP data base","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:886456f756c7781a040ef1aa78944e4748925063","amp;dn":"Eddie+Costa+Quintet%2C1957%2CFarmer%2CWoods%2CMotian%2CVSOP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"886456f756c7781a040ef1aa78944e4748925063","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,100,86,247,86,199,120,26,4,14,241,170,120,148,78,71,72,146,80,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
