We learn of the greatest battles, the brave generals, the unprepared troops who valiantly stood up to the opposing forces with honor and dignity. What we do not often learn about is the behind the scenes. The quibbles between the men and the generals. What really happened to start the war.\r\n\r\nOften we think of this war as a step in the emancipation of slavery. What many donâ€™t realize is that the emancipation was only a byproduct of the war. With tensions brewing for years previous, the â€œfreeingâ€ of the slaves could be seen as a mere tactic in a series of moves to gain support. With violent starts, the war raged on beyond what anyone could have foreseen.\r\n\r\nThere were tales of bravery and of foolishness throughout the war. Through this book you will learn about both tragedy and heroics of the men that led and served. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n\r\n                          Visit us for more Awesome ebooks             \r\n\r\n                               http://booksdeity.com/\r\n \r\n                         **********************************","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:24ce52dd56d31205e63915382b7d3811dfc506a2","amp;dn":"The+Civil+War+by+John+Stewart+%7BBooksDeityTEAM%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"24ce52dd56d31205e63915382b7d3811dfc506a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,206,82,221,86,211,18,5,230,57,21,56,43,125,56,17,223,197,6,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
