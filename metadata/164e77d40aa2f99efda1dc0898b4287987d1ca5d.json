That means you WON&amp;#039;T get small pops at some of the loop points (such as Luigi&amp;#039;s Mansion at 1:30).  Besides a direct disc to vbr mp3 conversion, this also features a super extensive assortment of tags:\n\n-The titles are exactly as they appear in the game, accompanied by official OST titles in the comments (especially handy for the medleys)\n-In the Grouping tag is the game from which the song comes from.\n-The composers for nearly every song have been identified through extensive research -If you sort by year, you can see which songs were arranged for Brawl.\n-The vocal songs feature lyrics along with line by line translations.\n-Every track has different album art, a relevant screenshot from the official smashbros.com website.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:164e77d40aa2f99efda1dc0898b4287987d1ca5d","amp;dn":"Super+Smash+Bros.+Brawl+-+Music+Vault","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"164e77d40aa2f99efda1dc0898b4287987d1ca5d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,78,119,212,10,162,249,158,253,161,220,8,152,180,40,121,135,209,202,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
