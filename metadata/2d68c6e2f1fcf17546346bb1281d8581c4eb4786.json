Born with an uncanny ability, he can steal other people's memories, abilities, and expertise for a limited time. A man with a power like that could change the world, but as a professional gambler, con-man, and thief for-hire, Weaver prefers to look out for Number One. That is, until he finds himself drawn into a dangerous game of international intrigue where the rules keep changing, the players are hidden, and the first thing he stands to lose is his life. And maybe, just maybe, he isn't so unique after all. Collects the complete storyline from issues #1-6 of the regular monthly Uncanny comic book series.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d68c6e2f1fcf17546346bb1281d8581c4eb4786","amp;dn":"Uncanny_v01_-_Season_of_Hungry_Ghosts_%282014%29_%28Digital-Empire%29.cb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d68c6e2f1fcf17546346bb1281d8581c4eb4786","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,104,198,226,241,252,241,117,70,52,107,177,40,29,133,129,196,235,71,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
