Thanks to this book, you don't have to be Einstein to understand physics. It walks you through the essentials and gives you easy-to-understand and digestible information on this often-intimidating course. From sound and light waves to electric potential and electric energy, this no-nonsense guide makes this fascinating topic accessible to everyone. \n\nPhysics II 101 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ get a crash course on the main topics covered in a typical Physics II course and brush up on basic skills, like making conversions and working with scientific notation \n\nGet charged up ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ understand the role of electricity and magnetism in Physics II, from AC circuits to permanent magnets to magnetic fields \n\nRide the wave ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ learn how light waves interact and interfere with each other and how they bounce off things, pass through glass, and do all sorts of cool stuff \n\nGo exploring ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ take a look at the theory of special relativity and learn what Einstein (among other physicists) had to say about it \n\nOpen the book and find: \n\nA look at electric fields, voltage, and charge \n\nThe effects of resistors, inductors, and capacitors \n\nEverything you need to know about magnetism \n\nHow light interacts with lenses and mirrors \n\nThe scoop on sound, light, and other waves \n\nA look at special relativity \n\nThe relationship between energy and matter \n\nThe structure of atoms \n\nThe nuts and bolts of radioactivity \n\nLearn to: \n\nGrasp physics terminology \n\nGet a handle on quantum and nuclear physics \n\nUnderstand waves, forces, and fields \n\nMake sense of electric potential and energy \n\nPaperback: 384 pages \nPublisher: For Dummies (July 13, 2010) \nLanguage: English \n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b02129cd46f32564ab5ecbb28371efa9d40f1f54","amp;dn":"Physics+II+For+Dummies+%28For+Dummies+Math+%26+Science%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b02129cd46f32564ab5ecbb28371efa9d40f1f54","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,33,41,205,70,243,37,100,171,94,203,178,131,113,239,169,212,15,31,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
