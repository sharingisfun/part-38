Kicking things off with the Alice Cooper classic &quot;Halo of Flies,&quot; things are still as humid and dirty as ever with the Melvins, keeping things dark and warm with a layer of Jello on top for an interesting contrast. The rants are as visceral as ever, highlighted by &quot;Lessons in What Not to Become&quot; and &quot;Those Dumb Punk Kids (Will Buy Anything),&quot; where he ponders a world featuring &quot;Malcolm in the Middle in the Misfits/or Mary-Kate and Ashley/Gary Coleman in Black Flag/Courtney in Nirvana at last/and Emmanuel Lewis back in action singing for the Germs.&quot; While he spins these humorous fantasies, he also chastises punk band reunions in the same song and remakes &quot;California ÃƒÆ’Ã…â€œber Alles,&quot; updating it for the 21st century using Arnold as the protagonist in place of Jerry Brown -- an interesting contradiction in every sense. Toward the end some interesting remixes by DÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤lek and Al Jourgensen round things off nicely. Hopefully this isn't the last installment in this fascinating collaboration. \n\t- AMG\n\t\nThanks to the original uploader from a very nifty russian site\n\nContains:\nEAC log and NFO in russian\nCUE sheet\nAudiochecker log\n\nAdded:\nAccuraterip check, flac fingerprint\nReplayGain tags\nDeleted useless files (m3u, sfv)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c9e9c8952727009dd8bc3ba13cfab3c5cb96883","amp;dn":"Jello+Biafra+with+Melvins+--+Sieg+Howdy%21","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c9e9c8952727009dd8bc3ba13cfab3c5cb96883","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,158,156,137,82,114,112,9,221,139,195,186,19,207,171,60,92,185,104,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
