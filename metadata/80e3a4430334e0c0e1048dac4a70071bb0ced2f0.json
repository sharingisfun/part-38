The last of these, 1979's Fine Cuts, found the veteran harp man displaying all the facets of his sophisticated technique. On the straight blues cuts, his big, blowsy tone commands immediate attention, while his playing on such tunes as &quot;Don't Get Around Much Anymore&quot; and &quot;Relaxin'&quot; showcase his jazzy chops and knack for nimble, precise melodic runs.\n\nWalter Horton (1917-1981) was, quite simply, one of the most exciting, influential, tasteful, powerful and imaginative harmonica players of all time. He created a unique, fluid style that combined keen precision with a genius for tone, at the same time blending a sure mastery of his instrument with a rare emotional intensity. This quiet, shy man left his mark on dozens of classic Chess recordings that defined the Chicago blues style.\n\n\n\n01. Everybody's Fishing 2:59\n02. Don't Get Around Much Anymore 2:10\n03.
