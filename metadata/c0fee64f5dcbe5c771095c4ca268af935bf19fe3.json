And to see the wonderful places of worship, the awesome appearances of mosque being awaken at 5:00 AM every morning for the call to prayer and a time to worship. We give thanks to Efes Pilsen for inviting us to their wonderful country to perform in front of thousands of people whom have elevated to be called fans.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ ~John Lee Hooker, Jr.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c0fee64f5dcbe5c771095c4ca268af935bf19fe3","amp;dn":"%28Blues%29+John+Lee+Hooker+Jr.+-+Live+In+Istanbul%2C+Turkey","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c0fee64f5dcbe5c771095c4ca268af935bf19fe3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,254,230,79,93,203,229,199,113,9,92,76,162,104,175,147,91,241,159,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
