After Japanese-American Kaz Uni (the father of Guy's friend George) finds out Guy's mother is in the hospital and his father is dead, he invites Guy to stay with his family. As Kaz's parents speak little English, Guy begins to learn Japanese. Then, when Guy's mother dies, the Unis adopt him. He becomes especially close to Kaz's mother.\n\nAfter the attack on Pearl Harbor and the US entry into World War II, Gabaldon's foster family is sent to an Internment Camp at Camp Manzanar. Gabaldon is drafted, but fails his physical exam due to a perforated eardrum. When Gabaldon goes to visit the Unis, he learns that George has been allowed to join the army and is fighting in Italy. After making sure that &quot;mama-san&quot; does not object, he manages to enlist in the Marines on the strength of his language skills.\n\nGabaldon does not make a good first impression on Sergeant Bill Hazen at Camp Pendleton, but wins him over. When they are shipped to Hawaii to join the 2nd Marine Division, he gets himself, Hazen and Corporal Pete Lewis bottles of whiskey and dates with two Japanese-American women and standoffish reporter Sheila Lincoln. Sheila is disgusted by the behavior of the rowdy Marines, but eventually warms up to Gabaldon after a few drinks.\n\nGoing ashore on Saipan, he freezes at first when he comes under fire for the first time, but regains his composure. During the bloody campaign for the island, Gabaldon convinces the Japanese general to order approximately 1000 Japanese soldiers and 500 family members to surrender to the U.S.'\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:-\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 855 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 640x480\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 23.976\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams:  2\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime 131 mins\nSubtitles: None\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]\nDuration: 131 mins","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:024ed6ea756b57fe9a10b0bfc5b54ce216509dcb","amp;dn":"Hell+to+Eternity+%281960%29+Xvid+1cd+-+Jeffery+Hunter+Classic+War+Dr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"024ed6ea756b57fe9a10b0bfc5b54ce216509dcb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,78,214,234,117,107,87,254,154,16,176,191,197,181,76,226,22,80,157,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
