There was no explanation for his actions.\n\nStripped of his private investigator's license, and watched by the police, Parker is working in a Portland bar, holding down a job and staying out of trouble. But in the background, he is working on his most personal case yet, an investigation into his own origins and the circumstances surrounding the death of his father, Will.\n\nIt is an investigation that will reveal a life haunted by lies, by his mother's loss and his father's betrayal, by secrets kept and loyalties compromised.\n\nAnd by two figures in the shadows, a man and a woman, with only one purpose: to bring an end to Charlie Parker's existence.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b909eb6dc1d144d429c2d34a905ebf0a42ba52b2","amp;dn":"The+Lovers+-+John+Connolly.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b909eb6dc1d144d429c2d34a905ebf0a42ba52b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,9,235,109,193,209,68,212,41,194,211,74,144,94,191,10,66,186,82,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
