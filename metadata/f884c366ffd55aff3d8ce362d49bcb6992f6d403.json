Will Tenneray \nJohnny Cash ...  Abe Cross \n\nThe picture concerns upon a gun battle pits two individualist characters.It&amp;#039;s a serious ,mature Hollywood Western with particular character study about an aging gunslinger looking for peace,quiet but also money and unable to avoid his reputation and the duel-challenges it invites against the baby-faced gun-fisted kid(Keith Carradine).So many good actors such excellent actors Raf Vallone,Robert J. Wilke,Keith Carradine,Dana Elcar among them consent to appear in what amount small roles,besides make their debut film Johnny Cash and Eric Douglas (Kirk&amp;#039;s true son and recently deceased for abuse drug).The lion&amp;#039;s share of the acting meat deservedly goes to Johnny Cash in spite of his first film.There is ,in addition,Johnny Cash&amp;#039;s catchy theme and equally an impressive roaring climax with an amazing final showdown.It&amp;#039;s a better than average Western although a little slow moving.The motion picture is well directed by Lamont Johnson(Little Annie and Little Britches and Mackenzie break).If you&amp;#039;re a Western fan you can&amp;#039;t go far wrong with this. \n\n\nI have shrank the file size on this on purpose would appericate any comments on\nit.  Could make a difference on wether i shrink anymore or leave them as they rip.\n\nthank you\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f884c366ffd55aff3d8ce362d49bcb6992f6d403","amp;dn":"%7DA+Gunfight+%5B1971%5D+%28Alien%29+%40%21+.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f884c366ffd55aff3d8ce362d49bcb6992f6d403","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,132,195,102,255,213,90,255,61,140,227,98,212,155,203,105,146,246,212,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
