They are called Ã¢â‚¬Å“CampbellitesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ because they follow the false teachings of Alexander Campbell, their founder. Dr. Ruckman labels them Ã¢â‚¬Å“Water DogsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ because they are unsaved Gentile dogs depending on water baptism to save them rather than faith in the shed blood of the Lord Jesus Christ. In this booklet, the foundational proof texts for their heresies will be examined and shown that they are more akin to Roman Catholics than Bible-believing Christians. Personal illustrations are given to demonstrate the absurdity and extreme hypocrisy of the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Water Dogs.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nMore &quot;Why I am not...&quot; books in the Peter Ruckman Collection on TPB.\n\nDr. Peter S. Ruckman received his Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Alabama and finished his formal education with six years of training at Bob Jones University (four full years and two accelerated summer sessions), completing requirements for the Master of Arts and Doctor of Philosophy degree.\nReading at a rate of seven hundred words per minute, Dr. Ruckman had managed to read about 6,500 books before receiving his doctorate, and he still reads an average of a book each day.\nDr. Ruckman stands for the absolute authority of the Authorized Version and offers no apology to any recognized scholar anywhere for his stand. In addition to preaching the gospel and teaching the Bible, Dr. Ruckman has produced a comprehensive collection of apologetic and polemic literature and resources supporting the authority of the Authorized Version of the Holy Scriptures.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c0f846c49c68977763b03c634d8768ad9a660c7a","amp;dn":"Why+I+Am+Not+A+Campbellite+-+Dr.+Peter+S.+Ruckman","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c0f846c49c68977763b03c634d8768ad9a660c7a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,248,70,196,156,104,151,119,99,176,60,99,77,135,104,173,154,102,12,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
