To most fans, it will remain a bit of a mystery, as the two officially \nreleased versions were offered only to BowieNet members. \n\nA 3'31&quot; mix featured on the BowieNet CD-ROM, distributed in 1998 to new subscribers \nonly. The other officially released version is the Dillinja Mix, found on the \nliveandwell.com 2CD. \n\nA plethora of other mixes is promo-only. First of all, 7'42&quot; &quot;live&quot; version, supposedly \nrecorded in Amsterdam, Paradiso, 10-06-97, appeared on liveandwell.com (a section of \nBowieNet featuring live performances of the Earthling tour). This studio version, with a \nlive audience mixed in, also appeared on a promo cassette for liveandwell.com, but was \nomitted from the 2CD that was distributed to BowieNet members.  A 5-track in-house \nVirgin promo CDR, still labelled 'Funhouse', contained the Clownboy Mix, Clownboy Mix - \nVocal Up, Clownboy Mutant Mix, Clownboy Mutant Trance Mix and Clownboy Instrumental, \nwhile a second 3-track promo CDR labelled Funhouse contained Fade 1, Fade 2 and Remix; \nsee Promos for four different in-house promos. Four variations of the Clownboy remix \nhave appeared in rather poor quality on Glastonbury Messiah (BOW 2000). \n___________________________________________________________ \n\nThis torrent includes the Unauthorised Virgin promo disc: \n\n01.
