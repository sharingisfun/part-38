It is being produced by Jacknife Lee.\n\nThis album deals much more with normal day working\nlife than was addressed on Silent Alarm, drawing\nthemes from the 7 July 2005 London bombings,\nimmigration, drug abuse, Black British lifestyle,\nhomosexuality, and criticism of youth subculture.\nThe album has been mostly met with mixed reviews by\nweb-critics and fans alike, with the success of\nSilent Alarm setting high expectations for the next\nalbum.\n\nThe first single is &quot;The Prayer&quot;, due for release\non January 29, 2007.\n\nTwo songs that have been played live but did not\nmake it onto the album are &quot;England&quot; (Formerly\n&quot;Blue Moon&quot;) and &quot;We Were Lovers&quot; (Formerly &quot;Into\nThe Blue&quot; and &quot;Cells Shaped Like Stars&quot;). There is\nalso a never-before-heard track proclaimed to be on\nthe single for &quot;The Prayer,&quot; called &quot;Version 2.0.&quot;\n\n&quot;Song for Clay (Disappear Here)&quot; was originally\n&quot;Merge On The Freeway&quot; (and is inspired by the\nnovel Less Than Zero by Bret Easton Ellis), &quot;The\nPrayer&quot; was originally &quot;A Prayer To The Lord, &quot;On&quot;\nwas originally &quot;Wet,&quot; &quot;Where Is Home?&quot; was\noriginally &quot;Machine&quot; and &quot;Perfect Teens, and &quot;I\nStill Remember&quot; was originally &quot;It Started In An\nAfternoon.&quot;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01b4aad6e5d118e4ecd3076013d91d71a365fabc","amp;dn":"Bloc_Party-A_Weekend_in_the_City-Proper-2007-JUST","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01b4aad6e5d118e4ecd3076013d91d71a365fabc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,180,170,214,229,209,24,228,236,211,7,96,19,217,29,113,163,101,250,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
