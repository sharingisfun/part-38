The film is based on a novel by Heck Allen and stars Clark Gable, Jane Russell, Robert Ryan, Cameron Mitchell and Juan GarcÃƒÂ­a. \nOur overall rating for The Tall Men is: good, an engaging film that has much to commend it, particularly on the directing and writing fronts - give it a try. \n\nThey must have had The Tall Men in mind when they invented CinemaScope. It's a big, robust western that fills the wide screen with a succession of panoramic scenes of often incredible beauty.\n\nOne of Gable's later best features, still as tough and charismatic as ever. \n\nBy the time he made this spectacular western, Raoul Walsh had been making movies for well over 50 years and presented a superficially no-nonsense cattle-drive adventure. But the period is just after the Civil War and the Allinsons (Gable, Mitchell) are from the defeated South, now determined to make a new life. They join Stark (Ryan) a Northern businessman on a cattle drive. The further complication is a rivalry over a woman (Russell).\nThe blend of superbly handled action - including a stampede - with some sharp dialogue (especially between Gable and Russell) is complimented by the underlying tension and a complicated resolution when neither side 'wins'.\n\nAn unpretentious but masterly trail-drive epic, one of the purest and simplest examples of the effortless professionalism of Walsh and his collaborators (including co-writer Frank Nugent, John Ford's son-in-law and writer-in-chief), and almost incidentally a sustained exploration of the Western landscape and the place of the stock characters within it. Gable pushes the herd and his own horizons westward through disaster and peril; though the film is probably best remembered by some for Jane Russell's bath scene, frontier-style. \n\nVIDEO\nSize.... 1.82gb\nDuration.... 02:02:09\nCodec.... divx\nFrame Width..... 1280\nFrame Height.... 500\nData Rate.... 2016kbps\nFrame Rate.... 23F/S\nAUDIO\nBit Rate.... 128kbps....
