After a four-year gap between albums and plenty of touring, it's not surprising that Melville is a much more accomplished affair. Although the playing is much tighter and the lyrics far more ambitious, the album still drips with Canadiana, name-dropping three provinces, one city, and two famous Canadian bands, and features a cover of another Canadian legend. There's also a song in Canada's other official language. &quot;Horses&quot; and &quot;Saskatchewan&quot; stand out, but all of the material on this album has a self-confidence that the debut lacked, making it a much better starting point. \n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/about/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d66f5d3fa06fd1a29f915a71a1117d3d13165aa8","amp;dn":"Rheostatics...Melville%281991%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d66f5d3fa06fd1a29f915a71a1117d3d13165aa8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,111,93,63,160,111,209,162,159,145,90,113,161,17,125,61,19,22,90,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
