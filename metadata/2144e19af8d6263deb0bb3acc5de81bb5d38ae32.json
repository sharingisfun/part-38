Unfortunately, I was unable to attain a TS for this project.\n\n25th Hour is one of my favorite movies of all time.  To my dismay, it has never seen a bluray release and as of now there are no plans to ever release one.  It is a movie that anyone growing up through the struggles of September 11th can relate to, albeit riddled with controversial hate fueled regret.\n\nSo, why shouldn't you just download the file I mentioned above?\n\nGood question.  A number of you were frustrated, as was I, that there was a StarzHD logo in the bottom corner of the movie for 23,116 frames (approximately 16 minutes total).  This distracted viewers during some of the most emotional and crucial scenes in the film.  My main prerogative was to remove this logo to the best of my ability.

Thank you to the original uploader.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2144e19af8d6263deb0bb3acc5de81bb5d38ae32","amp;dn":"25th.Hour.2002.720p.HDTV.5.1.x264.NOLOGO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2144e19af8d6263deb0bb3acc5de81bb5d38ae32","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,68,225,154,248,214,38,61,235,11,179,172,197,222,129,187,93,56,174,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
