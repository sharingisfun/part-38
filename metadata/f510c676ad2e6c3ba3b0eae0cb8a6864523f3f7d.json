Throughout their career, the Alan Parsons Project recorded concept albums (including adaptations of Poe and Asimov books), with a revolving cast of session musicians. 1982's Eye in the Sky was their greatest success; the title track charted in the Top Ten on the pop charts and the album went platinum. Although they weren't able to repeat that success, the group maintained a devoted cult audience.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f510c676ad2e6c3ba3b0eae0cb8a6864523f3f7d","amp;dn":"The+Alan+Parsons+Project+24+Bit+Vinyl+Pack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f510c676ad2e6c3ba3b0eae0cb8a6864523f3f7d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,16,198,118,173,46,108,59,163,176,234,224,203,138,104,100,82,63,63,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
