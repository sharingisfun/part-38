One city. A destiny that binds them together. City Of Life is the FIRST film, produced and solely shot in the United Arab Emirates, and directed by an Emirati - Ali F. Mostafa. The central plot revolves around three parallel lives, amongst many cultures in one city, namely Dubai, thus highlighting the cityÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s vast cultural and ethnic diversity. A privileged young male Arab at odds with his cultural identity and his less fortunate street smart friend; a disillusioned Indian taxi driver who bears an uncanny resemblance to a famous Bollywood star; and a former Romanian ballet dancer now working as a flight attendant and searching for love and companionship ... these individuals all live in Dubai and their lives are about to collide for better or for worse in a city where ambition, growth and opportunity are encouraged and dreams can still manifest.\n \nCAST:\n \nAlexandra Maria Lara as Natalia Moldovan\n Sonu Sood as Basu\n Saoud Al Kaabi as Faisal\n The Narcicyst as Khalfan\n Susan George as Constance Bateman\n Jason Flemyng as Guy Berger\n Natalie Dormer as Olga\n Ahmed Ahmed as Nasser\n Habib Ghuloom as Faisal's Father\n Jaaved Jaffrey as Suresh Khan\n David Chant as Senior Flight Officer\n \nMOVIE INFO:\n \n\nDirected by\n \nAli F.
