But for some reason, their comics were scattered all across their issues.  The order the following stories showed up in were in issues #37, #25, #2, #45, #35, #38 and #42 respectively.  A lot of the inherent spookyness was lost when shown in simple Black and White, which you'd think would be the opposite in this case.\n\nenjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e992d010f599d032eda39ba253f2dca4e876d52","amp;dn":"Cossu+-+T01+-+Histoires+alarmantes+%281987%29+cbr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e992d010f599d032eda39ba253f2dca4e876d52","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,153,45,1,15,89,157,3,46,218,57,186,37,63,45,202,78,135,109,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
