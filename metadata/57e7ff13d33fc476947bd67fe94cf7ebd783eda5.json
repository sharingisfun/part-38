Hence many of these shows have the feel (but not the look) of a &quot;talent contest&quot; having little, or often no content of any interest. But, due to the sheer volume of shows produced, it is bound to happen that one or two quite exceptional artists will appear on the show each and every year.\n\nIt so happens that Season 44 of this program is available for download in its entirety, being hosted by one or two very generous individuals.\n\nSince each show would be either 2 Gigs (Later LiveÃ¢â‚¬Â¦) or 4 Gigs (LaterÃ¢â‚¬Â¦) in length, hosting an entire season of the show would be quite a large burden for any single individual. And, even if theoretically feasible, collective hosting of these shows in their entirety, *in reality* would probably be impossible to organize. However, I might as well make a suggestion that if someone were able to acquire one episode of this program and see that the seed count is exactly 1 (as it usually is) then seed that one episode indefinitely (or until its seed count increases beyond 3) and you would've done your part in maintaining the availability of the show overall ;)\n\nI went through season 44 and there were several acts that I liked, some I liked but &quot;could do without&quot; but mostly I found stuff that I had zero interest in. The show brings on a lot of bands and, you'll notice, have not saved any of their performances. It just seems like the year 2014 simply isn't a year for bands. Only individual artists seem to have anything going for them these days. It will surely be a long time before we see another &quot;Led Zeppelin&quot; let's say.\n\nHere are the acts I saved, that are included in this torrent, and that I will probably keep for a few months:\n\nFormat:\nArtist - Song Title.avi\n------------------------\nAgnes Obel - Aventine.avi\nAgnes Obel - Words Are Dead.avi\nAziza Brahim - Julud.avi\nClean Bandit w Rae Morris - Extraordinary.avi\nElbow - Charge.avi\nEngelbert Humperdinck w Jools Holland - Please Release Me.avi\nHurray for the Riff Raff - Blue Ridge Mountain.avi\nHurray for the Riff Raff - Look Out Mama.avi\nLucius - Go Home.avi\nNatalie Merchant - Texas.avi\nNeneh Cherry - Blank Project.avi\nNeneh Cherry - Buffalo Stance.avi\nSharon Van Etten - I love you but I'm lost.avi\nSt Vincent - Birth In Reverse.avi\nSt Vincent - Digital Witness.avi\nSt Vincent - Prince Johnny.avi\n\n-------------------------\n\nFor all but one of these, the original Dolby audio is contained in the &quot;Dolby&quot; subfolder as an .avi file. Merging a given video with the original audio is a simple matter of running a program like avidemux and selecting the corresponding audio track for output &quot;by file name&quot;.\n\nAll were created via demultiplex. No video encodings were involved.\n\n- Me","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:57e7ff13d33fc476947bd67fe94cf7ebd783eda5","amp;dn":"Jools.Holland.SE44.Highlights.1080p","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"57e7ff13d33fc476947bd67fe94cf7ebd783eda5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,231,255,19,211,63,196,118,148,123,214,127,233,76,247,235,215,131,237,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
