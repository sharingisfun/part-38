May you show them all someday.\n\n\nAndy Wicks is a forty-something father of two whoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s tried everything to quit smoking, from going cold turkey, to the latest patches and nicotine chewing gums.  So he figures he'll give this hypnosis thing a try. What's the worst that could happen? Unfortunately, Andy gets dealt a fate worse than death - high school! Transported back to 1985, Andy returns to his formative years as a gangly, awkward teenager. Is he doomed to relive the mistakes of his past, or has he been given a second chance to get things right? One thing's for sureÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ this time heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s going to ask out that girl from math class.\n\nWritten and illustrated by Alex Robinson (Box Office Poison, Tricked) and published by Top Shelf.\n\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1acc37cdfdc9f939d25f77a09fbf8ec42d2c833d","amp;dn":"Too+Cool+To+Be+Forgotten","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1acc37cdfdc9f939d25f77a09fbf8ec42d2c833d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,204,55,205,253,201,249,57,210,95,119,160,159,191,142,196,45,44,131,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
