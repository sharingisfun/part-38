The killer is still at large, and thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s only one surviving witnessÃ¢â‚¬â€the boy whose family was killed before his eyes. Whoever committed the crimes wanted this boy to die: heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s suffered more than one hundred knife wounds and lapsed into a state of shock. Desperate for information, Linna sees only one option: hypnotism. He enlists Dr. Erik Maria Bark to mesmerize the boy, hoping to discover the killer through his eyes.\n \nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the sort of work that Bark has sworn he would never do againÃ¢â‚¬â€ethically dubious and psychically scarring. When he breaks his promise and hypnotizes the victim, a long and terrifying chain of events begins to unfurl.\n \nAn international sensation, The Hypnotist is set to appear in thirty-seven countries, and it has landed at the top of bestseller lists wherever itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been publishedÃ¢â‚¬â€in France, Holland, Germany, Spain, Italy, Denmark. Now itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s turn. Combining the addictive power of the Stieg Larsson trilogy with the storytelling drive of The Silence of the Lambs, this adrenaline-drenched thriller is spellbinding from its very first page.\n\n                              Format 1 - .ePUB\n\n                              Format 2 - .Mobi\n\n                          Published - June 21st 2011\n\n                All my Ebook uploads are separated by Genre Tags \n\n \n            **Support Your Favorite Authors By Buying Their Books**\n\n\n                Check out all my Magazine and ebook uploads here.\n\n                    &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa2630c400eef1196ba2238e09cd96963db1ed43","amp;dn":"The+Hypnotist+by+Lars+Kepler+%28Joona+Linna+01%29+%28ePUB%2FMobi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa2630c400eef1196ba2238e09cd96963db1ed43","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,38,48,196,0,238,241,25,107,162,35,142,9,205,150,150,61,177,237,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
