She's a covert operative for the United States Department of Agriculture, and one its most lethal assassins. She has the equivalent of black belts in four different disciplines of martial arts hand-to-hand combat and is equally deadly with swords, throwing knifes, sniper rifles and handguns. She'll make a corpse out of anybody who tries to stand between her and completion of her current assignment-and that includes that nosy F.D.A. agent with the creepy cibopath power, Tony Chu!\n\n\nThanks to CPS for the excellent scan.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d044e3cc985b32485558ab8aa3fb640c47c4a801","amp;dn":"Chew+%237","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d044e3cc985b32485558ab8aa3fb640c47c4a801","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,68,227,204,152,91,50,72,85,88,171,138,163,251,100,12,71,196,168,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
