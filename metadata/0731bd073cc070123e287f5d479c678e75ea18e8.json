On a feeding encounter with a human gathering party, R meets Julie and feels an urge to protect her. What happens with that is the beginnings of a strangely warm relationship that causes R to start to regain his humanity. As this change spreads throughout the undead population, Julie and R eventually find they are facing a larger issue even as their friendship is challenged. Caught between the paranoid human forces and the ferocious Bonie zombies who are a mutual threat, R and Julie must find a way to bridge the sides for fight for a better world no one thought possible.\n\nGenre: Comedy | Horror | Romance\nIMDB Rating: 7.1/10 from 39,243 users Metascore: 59/100\nDirected by: Jonathan Levine\nStarring: Nicholas Hoult, Teresa Palmer, John Malkovich\n\nRelease Name: Warm.Bodies.2013.BDRip.XviD-SPARKS\nSize: 700 MB\nVideo: AVI | 640Ãƒâ€”272 | 853 kbps\nAudio: English | MP3 | 136 kbps\nRuntime: 98 mins\nSamples: Video @ #1, #2, #3","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0731bd073cc070123e287f5d479c678e75ea18e8","amp;dn":"Warm.Bodies.2013.BDRip.XviD-SPARKS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0731bd073cc070123e287f5d479c678e75ea18e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,49,189,7,60,192,112,18,62,40,127,93,71,156,103,142,117,234,24,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
