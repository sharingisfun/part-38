It saves time and extends user abilities on active work with flash-drives, portable drives, card readers and other gadgets. The program gives a highly customizable menu to manage external devices, displays what programs prevent stopping a device,\n\nHandy menu to control devices\n This menu is aimed to do the most frequent tasks in a click and allows you to: \n - See device drive size or empty space\n - Rename a device\n - Change a device image\n - Hide a device from the menu\n - Scan for hardware changes\n - Stop all devices at once\n\nDrive letter management\n - Hiding drives of empty card reader slots\n - Fixing a drive letter to a specific device\n - Preventing assigning of specific drive letters to hot-plug devices\n - You can change a drive letter or volume label quickly\n\nProgram autorun feature\n - Assign programs to be launched on: \n - After device connection\n - Before device disconnection\n - After device stopping\n - After device removal\n - Global or per-device settings\n - Predefined templates to setup your antivirus, a file manager or something else\n\nPortable application quick launcher\n - Just a small menu where you can add programsfilesfolders from your portable drive for quick launch\n\nReal Safe Device Removal\n - Display of processes preventing the device from being stopped...\n ... and the ability to kill these processes ...\n ... or just to unlock them from the device\n - Hotkeys to stop a device or call the menu\n - Stopping of all devices at once\n - Ability to stop SATA drives\n - Returning just stopped device back\n\nHonest Drive Speed Test \n Most other drive speed testers measure only the readwrite speed of large files, displaying a theoretical drive speed. This is not related to real-life speed as we often write plenty of small files to external drives.\n Our investigations shows that some flash drives have worse performance than other ones on writing of small files however their top performance at writing large files are the same. \n Zentimo measures the file readwrite speeds of 3 different file sizes: small files (32 KB), medium files (3 MB) and large files (100 MB) and displays all those measurements as well as an average. The average speed calculated by Zentimo reflects your drives real performance more accurately than characteristics from the vendor's specification.\n\nOS: Windows XP/2003/Vista/7/8\n\nHome Page: http://zentimo.com/index.htm\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://zentimo.com/features.htm#security&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://zentimo.com/features.htm#security&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c635cae8bd544dbd8f5c84900600c52ef03f0ab1","amp;dn":"Zentimo+xStorage+Manager+1.7.3.1227+with+Keygen+by+Senzati","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c635cae8bd544dbd8f5c84900600c52ef03f0ab1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,53,202,232,189,84,77,189,143,92,132,144,6,0,197,46,240,63,10,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
