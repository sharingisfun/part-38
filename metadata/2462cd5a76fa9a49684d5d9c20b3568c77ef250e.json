Make It Safe provides a science and risked-based intervention approach to the Australian food industry for the control of food safety hazards.\nThe huge variety of manufactured foods available to Australian consumers today has largely been the result of the hard work of a group of relatively small manufacturers. Small businesses make up around two-thirds of businesses in AustraliaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s food and beverage manufacturing industry. This book is aimed at those currently manufacturing food on a small-scale or those considering entering this market. It will assist those already operating a small business to develop a better understanding of key food safety systems, while those who are in the &quot;start-up&quot; phase will gain knowledge essential to provide their business with a solid food safety foundation...............\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2462cd5a76fa9a49684d5d9c20b3568c77ef250e","amp;dn":"Make+It+Safe%3A+A+Guide+to+Food+Safety-MANTESH","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2462cd5a76fa9a49684d5d9c20b3568c77ef250e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,98,205,90,118,250,154,73,104,77,93,156,32,179,86,140,119,239,37,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
