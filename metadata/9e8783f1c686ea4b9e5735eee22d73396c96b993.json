The album was produced by Parton and Steve Buckingham. The album had been a long-rumored project between the country queens for over a decade and received much publicity and acclaim upon its release, although its only single release, a remake of the longtime country female vocalist staple &quot;Silver Threads and Golden Needles&quot;, barely dented the charts. likely due to ageism from country radio. Record sales, however, placed the album at #6 on Billboard&amp;#039;s country album chart and #42 on Billboard 200, the pop album chart becoming Wynette&amp;#039;s second-highest ranking album on the pop chart and Lynn&amp;#039;s highest on the pop chart until her 2005 album Van Lear Rose.\n\n\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e8783f1c686ea4b9e5735eee22d73396c96b993","amp;dn":"Honky+Tonk+Angels+-+Silver+Threads+And+Golden+Needles","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e8783f1c686ea4b9e5735eee22d73396c96b993","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,135,131,241,198,134,234,75,158,87,53,238,226,45,115,57,108,150,185,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
