After years of reckless behavior, a heroin addiction and the destruction of her marriage, Strayed makes a rash decision. Haunted by memories of her mother Bobbi (Academy Award nominee Laura Dern) and with absolutely no experience, she sets out to hike more than a thousand miles on the Pacific Crest Trail all on her own. WILD powerfully reveals her terrors and pleasures as she forges ahead on a journey that maddens, strengthens, and ultimately heals her.\n\nDirector: Jean-Marc VallÃƒÂ©e\n\nWriters: Nick Hornby\n\nActors: Reese Witherspoon, Laura Dern, Thomas Sadoski, Gaby Hoffman, Kevin Rankin, Michiel Huisman\n\nGenre: Drama","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:260b90ddff3035c3cdfcd06d929efdefac8b1343","amp;dn":"WILD.+Official+Movie+Trailer+%5BHD%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"260b90ddff3035c3cdfcd06d929efdefac8b1343","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,11,144,221,255,48,53,195,205,252,208,109,146,158,253,239,172,139,19,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
