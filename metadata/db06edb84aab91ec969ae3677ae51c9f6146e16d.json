The lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, written in 1949 by Clive Staples Lewis, had all this and more. But Lewis did not stop there. Six more books followed, and together they became known as The Chronicles of Narnia. \n\nFor the past fifty years, The Chronicles of Narnia have transcended the fantasy genre to become part of the canon of classic literature. Each of the seven books is a masterpiece, drawing the reader into a land where magic meets reality, and the result is a fictional world whose scope has fascinated generations. Now, some of the most noted actors of our times have come together to read these extraordinary works. \n\nThis timeless boxed set includes all seven unabridged recordings: The Magician's nephew; The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe; The Horse and His Boy; Prince Caspian; The Voyage of the Dawn Treader; The Silver Chair; and The Last Battle. Deceptively simple and direct, The Chronicles of Narnia continue to captivate fans with adventures, characters, and truths that speak to readers of all ages, even fifty years after they were first published. \n\n\nJag har inte lyssnat genom dem sÃƒÂ¥ jag vet inte sÃƒÂ¤kert att alla funkar.\nHa ÃƒÂ¶verseende om jag gÃƒÂ¶r nÃƒÂ¥got fel, detta ÃƒÂ¤r den fÃƒÂ¶rsta torrenten jag seedar.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db06edb84aab91ec969ae3677ae51c9f6146e16d","amp;dn":"The+Complete+Chronicles+of+Narnia","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db06edb84aab91ec969ae3677ae51c9f6146e16d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,6,237,184,74,171,145,236,150,154,227,103,122,229,28,159,97,70,225,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
