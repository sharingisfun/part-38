Upon further listenings, more textures appear, and the album gains a calm sense of tension and reflectiveness. It's also Robert Plant's most personal record ever; he addresses the death of his son in the beautiful &quot;I Believe.&quot; Simultaneously, Fate of Nations is a political album -- &quot;Great Spirit&quot; and &quot;Network News&quot; are two of the most socially conscious songs Plant has ever written. Yet, the album is never heavy-handed and doesn't fall into sermonizing or sentimentality. Plant has always had a folkie heart; on Fate of Nations, he wears it on his sleeve","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:adefa74eec7fd2fa94ea28112a8e9675404b1592","amp;dn":"Robert+Plant+-+Fate+Of+Nations+%5BFlac%5D%5BTntVillage%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"adefa74eec7fd2fa94ea28112a8e9675404b1592","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,239,167,78,236,127,210,250,148,234,40,17,42,142,150,117,64,75,21,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
