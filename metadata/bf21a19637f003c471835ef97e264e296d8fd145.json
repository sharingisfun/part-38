That's Trent, and there is a similar noise in a remix of Head Like A Hole (on the Head Like A Hole single)\n\nTrent Reznor was also involved in Doom 3, and when ATI leaked the E3 demo version, Trent's sounds were leaked with it.\nTrent left the Doom 3 team before it was finished, so it's unknown exactly which sounds were his from this demo.\nBut if you listen to the &quot;pain&quot; and &quot;jump&quot; noises, they sound very familiar.\n\n\nSo these are genuine Trent Reznor created sounds.\nIdeal samples for drum loops and other remixes.\nOr make a flash game with Trent running around shooting zombies.\n\n\nremix.nin.com is unlikely to approve any remixes made from these sounds, so feel free to upload to  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.ninremixes.com/upload_unofficial.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.ninremixes.com/upload_unofficial.php&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor official and unofficial nine inch nails multi-tracks, see   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.ninremixes.com/multitracks.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.ninremixes.com/multitracks.php&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThe music from Quake is also available here, if you'd like to remix those also. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4331685/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4331685/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nThe format of the audio is untouched from the original source\nBut the directory structure has been altered.\nIf you want to use Trent's Doom 3 sources in-game, google it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf21a19637f003c471835ef97e264e296d8fd145","amp;dn":"Trent+Reznor+%2B+Nine+Inch+Nails+-+Quake1+and+Doom3+sounds","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf21a19637f003c471835ef97e264e296d8fd145","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,33,161,150,55,240,3,196,113,131,94,249,126,38,78,41,109,143,209,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
