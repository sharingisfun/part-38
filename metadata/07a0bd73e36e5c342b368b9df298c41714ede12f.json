But no young man seems to want to marry a bluestocking like her. Her neighbour Inder who is a notorious rake, befriends her and this raises the ire of her family. Her father throws her out. What follows is a story of a beautiful friendship, love. loss and reconciliation..\r\n\r\nComments:\r\nIf I were to describe the movie in one word, it would be &quot;SILLY&quot;! Almost every scene in the film is cliched or downright silly. These are scenes we have seen a zillion times before. And ever since the 1772 film &quot;Love Story&quot; (Ail McGraw, Ryan Oneill), it has almost become a fashion to kill off the heroine with an incurable disease at the end leaving a grieving but steadfast hero! Why don't we, for a change, come across a movie in which the opposite happens? The hero dies and the heroine is left distraught?\r\n\r\nI won't go into the silliness of the movie scene bu scene for lack of space. The weakness of the script is compounded by some determined hamming by the actors, in particular Manish Chaudhary as the father of the bride. The hero, just manages to look good and manages little else. The music is pedestrian. the editor obviously went to sleep for the movie goes on and on for a dreary two and a half hours for no logical reason.\r\n\r\nThere are teo redeeming features in the film. First the heroine who has a unfamiliar name (Mawra Hocane). She brings a freshness and vivacity to her otherwise weepy role. The second is the cinematography of Chirantan Das, who gives us some breathtaking shots. I'd love to see a house like Inder Lal's in Mumbai though!\r\n\r\nUploader's Notes:\r\nA very good quality DVD with few flaws. The HEVC rip consequently has come out very well. I just had to bring out the details a bit and co minor coloue corrections. Luminance values of the scenes have been increased a bit.\r\n\r\nThe 10-bit compressibility and the magic of x265, allowed us to compress the video to just 700 MB and yet maintain full quality. By and large, this is almost like the untouched DVD - perhaps a shade better.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this rip (and all HEVC rips) will not play on most stand-alone devices. You can only watch this on a computer or a compatible device. On your computer be sure that you have the latest versions of VLC (2.1.5 or higher) or Media Player Classic (Ver 1.7.9) or SMPlayer (14.9.0). Earlier versions may not work\r\n\r\nIMDB Link: \nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt5255710/\r\n\r\nMake sure it is Genuine DDR release @ ExtraTorrent.com\r\n                       \nhttps://extratorrent.cc/                       \nhttps://extratorrent.com/                       \nhttp://extratorrent.ws/                       \nhttps://etproxy.com/                       \nhttps://extratorrentlive.com/                       \nhttps://extratorrentonline.com/                       \nhttps://etmirror.com/                       \nhttps://extratorrent.works/                       \nhttps://extratorrent.date/\r\n\r\n\r\nShare your Images with:\r\n                       \nhttp://extraimago.com/\r\n\r\nHelp us by donating with Bitcoin: 1XeH1kKXWYbzZcFHokGiZ4d3MWW5WyXzU","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:07a0bd73e36e5c342b368b9df298c41714ede12f","amp;dn":"Sanam+Teri+Kasam+-+DVD.Rip+-+HEVC+-+x265.AAC.Esubs+-+1+CD%5BDDR%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"07a0bd73e36e5c342b368b9df298c41714ede12f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,160,189,115,227,110,92,52,43,54,139,157,242,152,196,23,20,237,225,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
