Today they&amp;#039;re remembered not only for their smashes &quot;The Letter&quot; and &quot;Cry Like a Baby,&quot; but as the launching pad for singer Alex Chilton, who went on to become one of rock&amp;#039;s most revered cult figures thanks to his groundbreaking power pop unit Big Star. In his teenage years, Chilton was an amazingly gritty Memphis soul belter akin to an American version of the Spencer Davis Group&amp;#039;s Stevie Winwood. The Box Tops&amp;#039; music also encompassed touches of pop and psychedelia, although the group&amp;#039;s own lack of control over it eventually led to their split-up.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:88b8115aa6a133823ba2bcd3cc15b24bd887dd4d","amp;dn":"The+Box+Tops+-+Yesterday+Where%5C%27s+My+Mind","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"88b8115aa6a133823ba2bcd3cc15b24bd887dd4d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,184,17,90,166,161,51,130,59,162,188,211,204,21,178,75,216,135,221,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
