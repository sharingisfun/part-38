In this town, heroic hunter Eamon Sullivan dominates the headlines, while his brother Declan, a nightwatchman, tires of looking on. As the last pterodactyl and its trackers circle each other above four-story tenements, brick smokestacks, and wooden watchtowers, a face-to-face showdown may prove to be the end for all of them.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa2f7e6d32b9e62cedfaf5b05147eb62d47e3a58","amp;dn":"Pterodactyl+Hunters+In+The+Gilded+City","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa2f7e6d32b9e62cedfaf5b05147eb62d47e3a58","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,47,126,109,50,185,230,44,237,250,245,176,81,71,235,98,212,126,58,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
