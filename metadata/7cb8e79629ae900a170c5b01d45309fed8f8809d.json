The same year his first real solo album was released, Blue Train, before he played on DavisÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ seminal Kind of Blue and released his second major solo work, Giant Steps. At this stage Coltrane was at the forefront of the innovative changes in jazz, moving from the usual hard-bop style to the modal form that Kind of Blue introduced. Coltrane took modal jazz and ran with it through the 60s - from My Favourite Things (1961) and Live at the Village Vanguard (1962), to Duke Ellington and John Coltrane (1962) and John Coltrane and Johnny Hartman (1963), Coltrane produced innovative and complex jazz that divided the critics of the time, but is now accepted as era defining. In 1965, Coltrane and his quartet released his most famous record, the deeply spiritual A Love Supreme, which has since been regularly acknowledged as one of the greatest jazz albums ever.\n\nAfter A Love Supreme, Coltrane became more interested in free jazz, as shown on the classic Ascension. After adding Pharoah Sanders to his band, Coltrane began to take hallucinogenic drugs and his music became more spaced-out, alienating some listeners. In 1967 Coltrane was diagnosed with liver cancer, and he died shortly afterwards at the age of 40, leaving a hugely influential legacy of jazz. His spirituality was influential too - in 1971 a San Francisco church began worshipping Coltrane as a saint.\n\n-SoundUnwound\n\nDisc I\n01 Greensleeves - Traditional\n02 Naima - Coltrane\n03 Impressions - Coltrane\n04 Spiritual - Coltrane\n05 Chasin' the Trane - Coltrane\n\nDisc II\n01 Soul Eyes - Waldron\n02 Miles' Mode - Coltrane\n03 What's New? - Haggert, Burke\n04 In a Sentimental Mood - Ellington\n05 Take the Coltrane - Ellington\n06 My One and Only Love - Mallin, Wood\n07 After The Rain - Coltrane\n08 Afro Blue - Santamaria\n09 I Want to Talk About You [Live] - Eckstine\n10 Alabama - Coltrane\n\nDisc III\n01 Crescent - Coltrane\n02 Bessie's Blues - Coltrane\n03 A Love Supreme, Pt. 1: Acknowledgement - Coltrane\n04 Nature Boy - Ahbez\n05 Chim Chim Cheree - R &amp; R Sherman\n06 Dear Lord - Coltrane\n07 Living Space - Coltrane\n08 Welcome - Coltrane\n09 Offering - Coltrane","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7cb8e79629ae900a170c5b01d45309fed8f8809d","amp;dn":"John+Coltrane+-+A+John+Coltrane+Retrospective+-+The+Impluse%21+Yea","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7cb8e79629ae900a170c5b01d45309fed8f8809d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,184,231,150,41,174,144,10,23,12,91,1,212,83,9,254,216,248,128,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
