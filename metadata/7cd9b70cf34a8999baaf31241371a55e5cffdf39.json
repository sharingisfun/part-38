Kirkland, -Computer Science: Notable Research and Discoveries-\n\nEnglish | ISBN: 0816074410 | 2010 | 208 pages | PDF | 6 MB\n\n\n\nComputer science is a rapidly growing discipline that continues to awe, inspire, and intimidate all those who interact with its many elements and capabilities. Used in businesses and at home, computers underlie extensive communication networks such as the Internet, help pilots and astronauts fly airplanes and the space shuttle, maneuver a vehicle on Mars, sort mail based on typed or handwritten addresses, and much more.\n\nNo one is certain how much more powerfulÃ¢â‚¬â€and possibly intelligentÃ¢â‚¬â€computers will become in the 21st century. Exploring six prominent topics in computer science research, this new title describes how computer scientists conduct research and attempt to formulate answers to important questions. Research published in journals, presented at conferences, and described in news releases supplies plenty of examples of scientific problems and how researchers attempt to solve them.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7cd9b70cf34a8999baaf31241371a55e5cffdf39","amp;dn":"Computer+Science%3A+Notable+Research+and+Discoveries","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7cd9b70cf34a8999baaf31241371a55e5cffdf39","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,217,183,12,243,74,137,153,186,175,49,36,19,113,165,94,92,255,223,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
