The selected articles address such issues as the formation of rogue waves due to modulational instability of nonlinear wave field, physical and statistical properties of extreme ocean wave generation in deep water as well as in shallow water, various models of nonlinear water waves, special analysis of nonlinear resonances between water waves and the relation between in situ observations, experimental data and rogue wave theories. In addition, recent results on tsunami waves due to subaerial landslides are presented. This book is written for specialists in the fields of fluid mechanics, applied mathematics, nonlinear physics, physical oceanography and geophysics, and for students learning these subjects","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b67e32ea335f6cc4a893044bec3d6f8b94fafbcd","amp;dn":"Extreme+Ocean+Waves+-+2nd+Ed+-+2016+Ed+%282015%29.pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b67e32ea335f6cc4a893044bec3d6f8b94fafbcd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,126,50,234,51,95,108,196,168,147,4,75,236,61,111,139,148,250,251,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
