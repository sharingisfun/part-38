His detailed analysis serves not only as a guide to reading the global warming skeptics, but also as a model for assessing the state of climate science. With attention to the complexities of climate-related phenomena across a range of areasÃ¢â‚¬â€from Arctic sea ice to the Antarctic ice sheetÃ¢â‚¬â€The Lomborg Deception also offers readers an enlightening review of some of todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most urgent climate concerns.\n\nFrielÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s book is the first to respond directly to LomborgÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s controversial research as published in The Skeptical Environmentalist (2001) and Cool It: The Skeptical EnvironmentalistÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Guide to Global Warming (2007). His close reading of LomborgÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s textual claims and supporting footnotes reveals a lengthy list of findings that will rock climate skeptics and their allies in the government and news media, demonstrating that the published peer-reviewed climate science, as assessed mainly by the U.N.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, has had it mostly rightÃ¢â‚¬â€even if somewhat conservatively rightÃ¢â‚¬â€all along. FrielÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s able defense of Al GoreÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s An Inconvenient Truth against LomborgÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s repeated attacks is by itself worth an attentive reading.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:49f5ab6c4714485d0be5d3771a390dd8361de369","amp;dn":"The+Lomborg+Deception+-+Friel%2C+Howard+%5BNon-Fiction%5D+Mobi%2FEpub%2FPD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"49f5ab6c4714485d0be5d3771a390dd8361de369","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,245,171,108,71,20,72,93,11,229,211,119,26,57,13,216,54,29,227,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
