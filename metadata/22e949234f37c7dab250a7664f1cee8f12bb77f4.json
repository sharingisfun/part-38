When George (Rod Taylor) sits at the control of his new creation, he has all the time in the world. He's invented a Time Machine that whisks him from 1899 to war-ravaged moments of the 20th century and into 802701.....In that far-off era, passive Eloy face a grim future as prey to the glow-eyed subterranean Morlocks.....unless the time-travelling stranger from the past intervenes.\n\nAt the controls of the movie of H.G.Wells'classic &quot;The Time Machine&quot; (here digitally restored and remastered and in remixed Dolby Stereo) is effects trailblazer George Pal, whose features and shorts films won a combined seven Oscars and Special Awards. One winner was this beloved adventure loaded with visual marvels, from the nuclear destruction of London (complete with lava eruption) to the colourful whirlgig of time travel.\n\nSo, enjoy with this, and have a good download!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22e949234f37c7dab250a7664f1cee8f12bb77f4","amp;dn":"The+Time+Machine+%281960%29+PAL+DVD9","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22e949234f37c7dab250a7664f1cee8f12bb77f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,233,73,35,79,55,199,218,178,80,167,102,79,28,238,143,18,187,119,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
