The band found\nimmediate success with the release of their debut album Core in\n1992, which was certified 8x platinum. Despite high sales, the\nalbum received negative reviews from critics who thought of the\nband as &quot;grunge rip-offs&quot;. Throughout their career, STP became one\nof the most popular rock bands of the 1990s, but were plagued with\nproblems stemming from Weiland&amp;#039;s drug addiction and run-ins with\nthe law. In 2003, the band released the greatest hits compilation\nThank You. Around this time, band members began going their\nseparate ways. After the band&amp;#039;s break-up in 2003, Weiland became\nthe frontman of Velvet Revolver with former members of Guns N&amp;#039;\nRoses. The DeLeo brothers formed the band Army of Anyone with\nRichard Patrick of the band Filter. Kretz founded Bomb Shelter\nStudios in Los Angeles.  The band reunited in 2008 after Weiland\nsplit from Velvet Revolver, kicking off the tour at the Rock on\nthe Range festival in Columbus, Ohio and wrapped up on October 31,\n2008 in Pelham, Alabama. The band has already crafted new material\nand will begin recording early next year. The band&amp;#039;s five studio\nalbums have sold over 17 million copies in the United States alone\nand nearly 40 million albums worldwide. The band has had fifteen\ntop ten singles on the Billboard rock charts, including six number\nones, and one number one album on the pop charts (1994&amp;#039;s Purple).\nIn 1993, the band won a Grammy for &quot;Best Hard Rock Performance&quot;\nfor their song &quot;Plush&quot;. Stone Temple Pilots were also ranked at\nnumber 40 on VH1&amp;#039;s The 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2777e4528e1d49193e3a5235d8af243eddf7ecad","amp;dn":"Stone_Temple_Pilots-Buy_This-2008-MTD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2777e4528e1d49193e3a5235d8af243eddf7ecad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,119,228,82,142,29,73,25,62,58,82,53,216,175,36,62,221,247,236,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
