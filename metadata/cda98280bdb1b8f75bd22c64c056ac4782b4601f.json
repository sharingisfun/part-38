Contact (4:31)\n\n\n'Brilliant' is the brand new studio album from classic line-up Ultravox (Midge Ure, Billy Currie, Chris Cross &amp; Warren Cann), their first new studio album in almost three decades.\n\n&quot;Brilliant, is a bitter sweet comment on pop culture. &quot;You, the brilliant thing you are, outshine the brightest star, so distant and too far&quot;. It's about the other side of fame and success, a song about the bright young things that ignore the consequences of fame with the ensuing burn out rate...In a way it should read 'Brilliant' with a question mark.&quot; ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cda98280bdb1b8f75bd22c64c056ac4782b4601f","amp;dn":"Ultravox+-+Brilliant+%282012%29+%5BWavePack%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cda98280bdb1b8f75bd22c64c056ac4782b4601f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,169,130,128,189,177,184,247,91,210,44,100,192,86,172,71,130,180,96,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
