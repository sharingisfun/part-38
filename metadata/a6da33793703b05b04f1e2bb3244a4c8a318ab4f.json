Contemporary Boron Chemistry encompasses inorganic and organic compounds as well as polymers, solid-state materials, medicinal aspects and theoretical studies. Covering many areas of chemistry with boron at its centre, topics include applications to polyolefin catalysis, medicine, materials and polymers; boron cluster chemistry, including carboranes and metal-containing clusters; organic and inorganic chemistry of species containing only 1 or 2 boron atoms; and theoretical studies of boron-containing compounds. New materials with novel optical and electronic properties are also discussed. Comprehensive and up to date, graduates and researchers in a wide range of fields, particularly those in organometallic and organic chemistry and materials science, will welcome this book.\n\n\n\n\n# Hardcover: 554 pages\n# Publisher: Royal Society of Chemistry; 1 edition (June 23, 2000)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0854048359\n# ISBN-13: 978-0854048359","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a6da33793703b05b04f1e2bb3244a4c8a318ab4f","amp;dn":"Contemporary+Boron+Chemistry%5BBBS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a6da33793703b05b04f1e2bb3244a4c8a318ab4f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,218,51,121,55,3,176,91,4,241,226,187,50,68,164,200,163,24,171,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
