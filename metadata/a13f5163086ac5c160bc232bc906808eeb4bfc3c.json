While the album was released about two years after Vaughan's death in 1990, the actual performance took place on April 1, 1980 at Steamboat 1874 in Austin, Texas, and was broadcast live on KLBJ-FM radio. A 25-year-old Vaughan, still more than three years away from the release of his first studio album, performs with his &quot;Double Trouble&quot; bandmates: Chris Layton, drummer, and Jackie Newhouse, bassist. (Newhouse was replaced by bassist Tommy Shannon in January 1981, who would remain part of Double Trouble until Stevie's death.)\n\nTracklist\n1.In The Open ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:57\n2.Slide Thing ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:18\n3.They Call Me Guitar Hurricane ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:06\n4.All Your Love (I Miss Loving) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:23\n5.Tin Pan Alley ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:40\n6.Love Struck Baby ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:56\n7.Tell Me (Chester Burnett  ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:48\n8.Shake For Me ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:04\n9.Live Another Day ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:49\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a13f5163086ac5c160bc232bc906808eeb4bfc3c","amp;dn":"Stevie+Ray+Vaughan++In+The+Beginning%28blues+rock%29%28flac%29%5Brogercc%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a13f5163086ac5c160bc232bc906808eeb4bfc3c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,63,81,99,8,106,197,193,96,188,35,43,201,6,128,142,235,75,252,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
