Who better than bestselling author and Vanity Fair columnist Dominick Dunne to expose the sordid secrets of America's rich and famous? Already an established Hollywood producer in the late 70s, Dunne left the world of Los Angeles to live a simpler kind of life and work on his writing. A personal tragedy soon gave Dunne a clear purpose: to draw attention to those members of high society who believe their wealth and privilege exempt them from legal repercussions. Eager to hold these parties accountable for their mistakes, Dunne has dedicated his time to exploring the seedy underbelly of fame and celebrity ever since.\n\n\nEpisode 1 : A Deadly Campaign - The Senate Campaign Hits\n\nRuthann Aron, 54, of Potomac, Maryland, knew exactly what she wanted and she wasn't going to let anyone get in the way of her achieving her goals. Aron, a feisty, self-made millionaire, makes an unsuccessful bid for Maryland's US Senate seat in 1994. She then orders a hit on a rival attorney and her husband in return for $20,000 cash. When investigators are tipped off by a local garbage hauler, Ruthann is arrested while playing in a charity golf tournament. Why would a once promising politician risk everything for a murder-for-hire scheme?\n\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 2250 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 624x472\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.322:1\nFrames Per Second: 29.970\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 448kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 5\nAudio Languages: english\nRunTime Per Part: 42:05.048\nNumber Of Parts: 8\nPart Size: 815 MB\nRipped by: DocFreak08\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7838ef1b0260d37b72716561b54670069f0bdd19","amp;dn":"CourtTV.Power.Privilege.and.Justice.1of8.A.Deadly.Campaign.XviD.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7838ef1b0260d37b72716561b54670069f0bdd19","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,56,239,27,2,96,211,123,114,113,101,97,181,70,112,6,159,11,221,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
