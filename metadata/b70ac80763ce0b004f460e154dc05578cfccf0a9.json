Circulation peaked at 187,000 in 2006 but by 2010 had dropped back to 145,000 in print, though digital subscriptions had risen to over 15,000.[5] Print ad pages declined by 5% from 2009 to 2010, while digital advertising rose 32.8% from 2009Ã¢â‚¬â€œ10.[6] Advertising accounts for 10% of total revenue for the magazine, while circulation totals 60%.[5] The Nation has lost money in all but three or four years of operation and is sustained in part by a group of more than 30,000 donors called Nation Associates, who donate funds to the periodical above and beyond their annual subscription fees. This program accounts for 30% of the total revenue for the magazine. An annual cruise also generates $200,000 for the magazine.[5] Since late 2012, the Nation Associates program has been called Nation Builders\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b70ac80763ce0b004f460e154dc05578cfccf0a9","amp;dn":"The+Nation+-+21+April+2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b70ac80763ce0b004f460e154dc05578cfccf0a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,10,200,7,99,206,11,0,79,70,14,21,77,192,85,120,207,204,240,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
