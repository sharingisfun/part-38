Strangely enough, none of the tracks here appear on the greatest hits cd, Legend, although many are worthy. This cd has never left my 5 disc cd changer since I've owned it. This album also marks the first time Bob Marley and the Wailers made the charts in America. The band features 2 new guitarists (Donald Kinsey from Peter Tosh's Band, and Earl &quot;Chinna&quot; Smith a legendary Jamaican guitarist) and the guitar work is fantastic. This cd explores some new ground for reggae, and it is very good. From the opening notes of Positive Vibration, to the Speech by H.I.M transcribed to music in the song War, I was hooked as a Wailers addict for life. If you Want More Rastaman Vibrations, check out Live at the Roxy. Live the band gives off a huge vibe that is unmatched by anyone today and many of the songs on Live at the Roxy are Rastaman Vibration tracks. This cd is essential in any music collection. \n\nby &quot;jeffrodesiac&quot;\n\nTRACKLIST:\n\n01 - Positive Vibration.wma                                 \n02 - Roots, Rock, Reggae.wma                                \n03 - Johnny Was.wma                                         \n04 - Cry To Me.wma                                          \n05 - Want More.wma                                          \n06 - Crazy Baldhead.wma                                     \n07 - Who The Cap Fit.wma                                    \n08 - Night Shift.wma                                        \n09 - War.wma                                                \n10 - Rat Race.wma                                           \n11 - Jah Live.wma\n\nWMA 320Kbps 44100Hz STEREO","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b2c098f871390f7ac8547d421c4bf5a0ba12f05","amp;dn":"Bob+Marley+And+The+Wailers+-+Rastaman+Vibration+%281976%29+WMA320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b2c098f871390f7ac8547d421c4bf5a0ba12f05","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,44,9,143,135,19,144,247,172,133,71,212,33,196,191,90,11,161,47,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
