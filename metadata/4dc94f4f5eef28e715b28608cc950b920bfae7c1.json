Originating from an initiative funded by a grant from the U.S. Department of State, DNA Analysis for Missing Person Identification in Mass Fatalities presents a collection of training modules that supply comprehensive instruction in these complex techniques. The book begins with a concise overview of DNA analysis methods and their use in identifying victims of mass fatalities. It then goes on to explore:\n\nMass fatality response operations, including body recovery, mortuary operations, family assistance, the identification of human remains, and psychosocial support for families\n\nBest practices in DNA sample collection and the different types of reference samples that can be used to identify a reported missing (RM) individual\n\nAutosomal short tandem repeat (STR) DNA profile analysis and interpretation, and procedures to ensure data accuracy\n\nMajor steps involved in generating a DNA profile and the complex aspects of data analysis and interpretation\n\nThe importance of data management using information technology tools, and tips for maintaining quality operations\n\nAccreditation and standards and the major elements of a DNA quality program\n\nSetting up a laboratory operation, including planning, staffing, identifying types of equipment and supplies, and the procedures for ensuring that laboratory equipment performs appropriately\n\nThe book includes a discussion of the key steps in the preparation, delivery, and evaluation of training sessions for personnel responding to a mass fatality human identification event. It also provides a comprehensive vocabulary list with terms related to mass fatality DNA identification. This text is a must-read for organizations contemplating the use of DNA in human identification initiatives following mass fatalities. It is also a tremendous value to emergency manager/planners, medical legal authorities, and forensic DNA laboratories.\n\nProduct Details:\n\nPDF: 304 pages\nPublisher: CRC Press; 1 edition (January 28, 2014)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1466513845\nISBN-13: 978-1466513846\nAmazon Link:\n\nContent Details:\n\nimage\n\n------------------------------------------------\nSeed - Share - Enjoy - Give me Thumbs Up\n------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4dc94f4f5eef28e715b28608cc950b920bfae7c1","amp;dn":"DNA+Analysis+for+Missing+Person+Identification+in+Mass+Fatalitie","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4dc94f4f5eef28e715b28608cc950b920bfae7c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,201,79,79,94,239,40,231,21,178,134,8,204,149,11,146,11,250,231,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
