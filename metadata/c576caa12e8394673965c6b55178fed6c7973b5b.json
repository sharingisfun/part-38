This album by Peace Family will take you to a state of bliss. It is a constantly shifting blend of beautiful voices, intricate guitar work and compelling percussion. Each selection has a story, sound and energy all its own. The title song, &quot;Reunion&quot;, tells the story of the Spirit of Khalsa, or Pure Ones, reaching out from the past to be felt in the present. Snatam's lead vocal and the back-up vocals of Livtar and Guru Ganesha are haunting and enchanting. When the group shifts into repetition of the mantra for spiritual ecstasy (Wha Guru), the effect is mesmerizing. It is impossible to sit still or to be sad while listening to the finger-snapping sounds of &quot;Invisible Lord&quot;. Snatam proves that she has the soul of a jazz singer, and Guru GaneshaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lead guitar work never fails to delight. &quot;Light of Peace&quot; is a powerful call for world peace written by Livtar Singh. He imagined it being sung in a stadium by thousands of swaying people holding candles and praying. Just listening to this song brings peace to the heart. The sometimes thin line between worldly and spiritual longing blurs in the unique love song, &quot;Star In My Sky&quot;. The band shows great versatility by supporting the heartfelt lyrics with a soothing bossa nova sound. There couldn't be a more perfect grand finale for the album than &quot;At the Feet of the Teacher&quot;. The majestic, ethereal voice of Snatam, combined with the sweet, rich sounds of Livtar's 12-string guitar, will deliver you to a perfect state of serenity. Close your eyes and listen to this album. You will be transported.\n\n1.Reunion 10.05\n2.Invisible Lord 7.05\n3.Light of Peace 8.38\n4.Star in my Sky 6.01\n5.At the Feet of the Teacher 14.17\n\nreference libFLAC 1.3.1 20141125\n\nSecure rip and AccurateRip verified.
