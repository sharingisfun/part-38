The play is set in the fictional community of Grover's Corners, modeled upon several New Hampshire towns in the Mount Monadnock region: Jaffrey, Peterborough, Dublin, and others. Using metatheatrical devices, Wilder sets the play in a 1930s theater. He uses the actions of the Stage Manager to create the town of Grover's Corners for the audience. Scenes from its history between the years of 1901 and 1913 play out.\n\nWilder wrote the play while in his 30s. In June 1937, he lived in the MacDowell Colony in Peterborough, one of the many locations where he worked on the play. During a visit to Zurich in September 1937, he drafted the entire third act in one day after a long evening walk in the rain with a friend.  In 1947, the Soviet Union banned Our Town and another Wilder play, The Skin of Our Teeth, for making family life seem &quot;too attractive.&quot;[1]\n\nOur Town is a character story about an average town's citizens in the early twentieth century as depicted through their everyday lives (particularly George Gibbs, a doctor's son, and Emily Webb, the daughter of the town's newspaper editor). Our Town was first performed at the McCarter Theater in Princeton, New Jersey on 22 January 1938. It next opened at the Wilbur Theater in Boston, Massachusetts on 25 January 1938. Its New York City debut was on 4 February 1938 at Henry Miller's Theatre, and later moved to the Morosco Theatre. The play was produced and directed by Jed Harris.[2] Wilder received the Pulitzer Prize for Drama in 1938 for the work\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Town&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Town&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0353849/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0353849/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n Cast (in credits order)\n\tJayne Atkinson\t... \tMrs. Gibbs\n\tWendy Barrie-Wilson\t... \tWoman in Balcony\n\tReathel Bean\t... \tMan in Auditorium\n\tJohn Braden\t... \tProfessor Willard\n\tTom Brennan\t... \tJoe Stoddard\n\n\tKieran Campion\t... \tBaseball Player\n\n\tPatch Darragh\t... \tBaseball Player\n\tFrank Converse\t... \tDr. Gibbs\n\n\tJane Curtin\t... \tMrs. Webb\n\tJeffrey DeMunn\t... \tMr. Webb\n\tMia Dillon\t... \tMrs. Soames\n\tConor Donovan\t... \tWally Webb\n\tBen Fox\t... \tGeorge Gibbs\n\tKristen Hahn\t... \tRebecca Gibbs\n\n\tCarter Jackson\t... \tSam Craig\n\tMaggie Lacey\t... \tEmily Webb\n\n\tStephen Mendillo\t... \tConstable Warren\n\n\tPaul Newman\t... \tStage Manager\n\tStephen Spinella\t... \tSimon Stimson\n\tT.J.
