It was written and illustrated by many hands.\n\nThe &quot;Dinosaur Tracking&quot; blog at Smithsonian.com, him say:\n\nDinosaurs: A Celebration was not a typical comic series. Run in four issues, the series covered Ã¢â‚¬Å“Bone-Heads and Duck-Bills,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Egg Stealers and Earth-Shakers,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Horns and Heavy ArmorÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Terrible Claws and Tyrants.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Instead of giving each dinosaur group one single storyline, though, representative species were brought to life in short comic stories which were sandwiched between explanatory sections about the state of knowledge about dinosaurs circa 1992. A preface to each issue by series editor Steve White explains that the series was meant to be as specific as possible, acting as a condensed dinosaur encyclopedia in addition to an anthology of illustrated stories.\n\nThe series was hit-and-miss. While the encyclopedia-type portions attempted to be educational, the short collections of semi-technical passages were dry and uninspiring, and the quality of the artwork varied from story to story. Late in the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Bone-Heads and Duck-BillsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ issue there is a beautifully illustrated tale about an attack on a Pachycephalosaurus herd by a Tyrannosaurus pack drawn by well-known paleo-artist Luis Rey, but a comic about South American sauropods illustrated by Chris Foss in another issue directly lifts poses from other works of paleo-art, and the dinosaurs have a lumpy, muddy look about them.\n\n\nProps to the creative teams and the scanners. Get it, seed it!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9a88f054ad69344ba83ac916a0860ee0c3452a9","amp;dn":"Dinosaurs+-+A+Celebration+%28epic+Comics%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9a88f054ad69344ba83ac916a0860ee0c3452a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,168,143,5,74,214,147,68,186,131,172,145,106,8,96,238,12,52,82,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
