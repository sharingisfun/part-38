They drive vehicles, use machinery, and\nlive in amazing castles and forts. But make no mistake about it: these are animals,\nwith claws, fangs, tails, and sometimes wings. And now they are engaged in a full\nscale conflict. Once a pristine, natural paradise, the land of CHIMA has become a\nbattle ground for the animal tribes. Best friends are now worst enemies. Weaponry\npummels the once-sacred temples. Animalistic vehicles charge furiously at each other\nin jungle jousts. The animals fight for control of a natural resource called CHI, a\npower that is both a source of life and holds the potential for destruction. Only a\nfew brave heroes in CHIMA understand the true nature of CHI and its importance.\nTheir stories, and the stories of those who seek to conquer the CHI, are known as...\nTHE LEGENDS OF CHIMA.\n\nProduced by M2Film and The LEGO Group.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img703.imageshack.us/img703/4220/legochimas103avi.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img703.imageshack.us/img703/4220/legochimas103avi.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\nCragger, under the influence of Crooler's magical flower, tricks Laval into\nwith holding the crocodiles' share of CHI, thus inflaming hostilities between\nthe Lion and Croc tribes yet again.\n\nLEGO.Legends.of.Chima.S01E03.The.Warrior.Within.WEB-DL.XviD.MP3.avi\n\nVideo: Xvid 624x352 23.976fps [Qf 0.18]\nAudio: MPEG Audio Layer 3 48000Hz stereo [128Kbps VBR]\nSubs: English Closed Captions (SubRip Text)\nDuration: 00:22:00\nFile size: 171 MB\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:546f59972cda0f6276ec07efb74996d2b9dd8d3b","amp;dn":"LEGO.Legends.of.Chima.S01E03.The.Warrior.Within.WEB-DL.XviD.MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"546f59972cda0f6276ec07efb74996d2b9dd8d3b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,111,89,151,44,218,15,98,118,236,7,239,183,73,150,210,185,221,141,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
