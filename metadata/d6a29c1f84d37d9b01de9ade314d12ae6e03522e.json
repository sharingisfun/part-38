That initial plan soon fell by the wayside when they secured a record deal and became Genesis, progressing from the underground scene with such albums as &quot;Trespass&quot; and &quot;Nursery Cryme,&quot; to become household names with the addition of drummer/singer Phil Collins and such chart topping albums as &quot;We Can't Dance&quot; and &quot;Invisible Touch.&quot; By talking to the individual members of the group, discover what they consider to be their favorite Genesis songs, and why certain songs have a special place in the Genesis story. Song include: I Can't Dance, Invisible Touch, Follow You Follow Me, The Musical Box, Supper's Ready, I Know What I Like (In Your Wardrobe), The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway, Afterglow, Misunderstanding, Turn It On Again, Mama, Land of Confusion. 100 minutes. \nTorrent contains Bonus Material as well an extra 40min.\n\nINFO: \nFormat : MPEG-4\nFormat profile : Base Media\nCodec ID : isom\nFile size : 963 MiB\nDuration : 59mn 47s\nOverall bit rate mode : Variable\nOverall bit rate : 2 253 Kbps\nWriting application : Lavf52.104.0\n\nVideo\nID : 1\nFormat : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile : Simple@L3\nFormat settings, BVOP : No\nFormat settings, QPel : No\nFormat settings, GMC : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix : Default (H.263)\nCodec ID : 20\nDuration : 59mn 46s\nBit rate : 2 063 Kbps\nWidth : 720 pixels\nHeight : 480 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 16:9\nOriginal display aspect ratio : 16:9\nFrame rate mode : Constant\nFrame rate : 29.970 fps\nStandard : NTSC\nColor space : YUV\nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0\nBit depth : 8 bits\nScan type : Progressive\nCompression mode : Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.199\nStream size : 882 MiB (92%)\nWriting library : XviD 1.2.1 (UTC 2008-12-04)\n\nAudio\nID : 2\nFormat : AAC\nFormat/Info : Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat profile : LC\nCodec ID : 40\nDuration : 59mn 47s\nBit rate mode : Variable\nBit rate : 185 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 6 channels\nChannel positions : Front: L C R, Side: L R, LFE\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\nCompression mode : Lossy\nStream size : 79.0 MiB (8%)\n\nSIZE: 1.55GB \n\nIMDb- http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0339057/\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6a29c1f84d37d9b01de9ade314d12ae6e03522e","amp;dn":"The+GENESIS+Songbook%28dvdripmp4%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6a29c1f84d37d9b01de9ade314d12ae6e03522e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,162,156,31,132,211,125,155,1,222,154,222,49,77,18,174,110,3,82,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
