It covers all the main issues including different ideas of God, the good and bad in religion, religious experience and neuroscience, pain and suffering, death and life after death, and includes interesting autobiographical revelations.\n\nReview\n'John Hick presents the case for and against religious faith lucidly and concisely in the form of a dialogue, opposing a wide range of assertions and arguments from the great world religions to the principles and counter-arguments of science-based materialism. Although the author makes his own position clear, the work is not didactic, and the reader is made to test his/her own faith or doubt against the various arguments put forward. This book is an illuminating, timely, humane contribution to a debate which often generates more heat than light, and for anyone with a serious personal interest in the subject it is as enthralling as a good play.' - David Lodge 'An excellent summary of Hick's refreshingly open and mind-expanding views on standard topics of Philosophy of Religion.' - Marilyn McCord Adams, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, USA. 'This book does an excellent job of presenting the heart of John Hick's arguments to the intelligent reader, without presupposing technical background.' -- Elizabeth Burns, Heythrop College, University of London, UK.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c6b7851a501b2c72f76fcd557a0598e5c93d9702","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B2010%5D+Between+Faith+and+Doubt+Dialogues+on+Religion+and+R","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c6b7851a501b2c72f76fcd557a0598e5c93d9702","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,183,133,26,80,27,44,114,247,111,205,85,122,5,152,229,201,61,151,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
