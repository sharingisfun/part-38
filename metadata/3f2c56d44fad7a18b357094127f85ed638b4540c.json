Clarke. The film deals with themes of human evolution, technology, artificial intelligence, and extraterrestrial life, and is notable for its scientific realism, pioneering special effects, and provocatively ambiguous imagery and sound in place of traditional narrative techniques.\nDespite receiving mixed reviews upon release, 2001: A Space Odyssey is today recognized by critics as one of the greatest films ever made.[1] It was nominated for four Academy Awards, and received one for visual effects. It also won the Kansas City Film Critics Circle Best Director and Best Film awards of 1968. In 1991, 2001: A Space Odyssey was deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in their National Film Registry.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f2c56d44fad7a18b357094127f85ed638b4540c","amp;dn":"2001%3A+A+Space+Odyssey","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f2c56d44fad7a18b357094127f85ed638b4540c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,44,86,212,79,173,122,24,179,87,9,65,39,248,94,214,56,180,84,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
