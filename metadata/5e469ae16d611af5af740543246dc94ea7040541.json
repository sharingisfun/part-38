It introduced new readers to the work of Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, Steve Ditko, and other Marvel creators, and packaged the material in a traditional book format that carried more cachÃƒÂ© than the flimsy pamphlet style of a typical comic book. Many of the books featured painted covers illustrated by such artists as Bob Larkin, John Romita, Sr., and Earl Norem. In this way, the series was an antecedent to the now common practice of packaging &quot;classic&quot; stories into archival editions and trade paperback collections including Marvel's 1998 book Grandson of Origins of Marvel Comics.\n\n------\n\nThe essays by Stan Lee are fascinating reads, but these very old (almost 40 years) collected editions feature great Marvel stories from Fantastic Four #1 (1961) to Ka-Zar #1 (1997). The three books in this torrent run over 700 pages (about 230 to 240 pages each). All credit to the original scanners!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e469ae16d611af5af740543246dc94ea7040541","amp;dn":"ORIGINS+OF+MARVEL+COMICS+%283+trade+paperback+series%29+1974-1998","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e469ae16d611af5af740543246dc94ea7040541","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,70,154,225,109,97,26,245,175,116,5,67,36,109,201,78,167,4,5,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
