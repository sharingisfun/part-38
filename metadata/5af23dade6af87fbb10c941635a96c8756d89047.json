Over the week, Alex has offered up nine candidates to be put through a rigorous interview process. It's now the final interview. With just two candidates having secured their places, it's back to the shortlist to give one chef a golden opportunity.\n\nTheir challenge is the ultimate test - to produce an authentic three-course menu to be tested by a restaurant full of owners Jay and Uttam's toughest critics... their loyal regulars. The candidates also have to manage a brigade of chefs testing not only their cooking skills but also their ability to run a kitchen.\n\nWhen true expectations come to light, it calls for a tough early decision to be made. Will an Indian variation of fish and chips delight or dismay? Can an out-of-this-world dessert be enough to sweeten the deal? And can the chefs work together to run a smooth service and satisfy the owners and diners' demands?\n\nAt the end of the night, one candidate will be selected to become the new head chef - and it's a tough decision.\n\n\n\n\nOriginal Air Date: 26-Jun-2015","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5af23dade6af87fbb10c941635a96c8756d89047","amp;dn":"Alex.Polizzi.Chefs.On.Trial.S01E16.480p.WebRip.x264-RMTeam.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5af23dade6af87fbb10c941635a96c8756d89047","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,242,61,173,230,175,135,251,177,12,148,22,53,169,108,135,86,216,144,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
