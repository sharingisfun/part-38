Other goals were Chromebook like speed together with ease of use. \n\n Ã¢â‚¬Å“BlueÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ was the MS codename for Win 8.1, which hopefully it should leave trailing in the dust. \n\n It is likely to polarise opinion and is based on Quirky Tahr version 6.05 k3-12-6. \n The install is to a USB2 or USB3 stick of at least 8GB. \n\n By default it boots to the Metro interface but that behaviour is easily changed so that it boots instead to a standard desktop. The left hand Windows key is used to launch or re-launch the Metro interface. The right hand Windows key switches to the standard desktop as does the menu key. \n\nTechnical Stuff: \n\n Whilst the full screen Metro interface is fine for launching a web based application or a locally held text file, it cannot launch a local app and the use of ALT+TAB can be a pain if you have several apps open. It is also far too easy to launch the same app twice. \n The solution adopted is to rely on key bindings which pass variables to a script which in conjunction with wmctrl raise a window and give it focus if an app is already running or if it is not running, launch it or another script to do so. This sounds complex but is all in the background. In practice, if at any point you are in the Metro or standard desktop interface and wish to launch or raise E-mail for example you only have to press ALT+E. \n\nItems Installed/Modified.

(If not possible with 1 or 2) \n\n F11 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Toggle display of bookmarks bar. \n\nWhere to obtain the IMG.XZ (575 MB) \n\n The img.xz and win32diskimager-v0.7-binary together with their MD5s are to be found here: \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.puppylinuxstuff.meownplanet.net/ETP/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.puppylinuxstuff.meownplanet.net/ETP/&lt;/a&gt; (Australia) \n\nInstall Procedure: \n\n I cannot do better than quote from BarryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s notes. \nQuote:\nMethod D: 8GB image \n This ready-to-go for a 8GB (or greater) USB Flash stick or SD card. The steps, for Linux: \n\n Download quirky-6.1-8gb.img.xz, from one of the above links. \n Expand and install (for example of Flash drive being sdb) (in a non-Puppy distro, you might have to do the 'sudo' thing, to run as root): \n # xz --decompress --stdout quirky-6.1-8gb.img.xz &gt; /dev/sdb \n # sync \n Further documentation is required to do this from Windows. Well, you might look here: \n &lt;a href=&quot; http://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/&lt;/a&gt; \n ...but, you will need to first install an application such as 7-zip (http://www.7-zip.org/), that can uncompress an .xz file -- and be prepared, it will expand to a 7.6GB file, so make sure the partition has enough space! \n\n If you use a 16GB or bigger drive, no problem, you can use GParted (which is in Quirky) later to create an extra partition to fill the drive. Note, f2fs can not yet be resized. \n\n\n 7-Zip should be used to decompress the 8GB image. (The PortableApps.com version is recommended) \n\n A well illustrated guide to using win32diskimager can be found here: \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://meego.com/devices/netbook/installing-meego-netbook/windows-instructions&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://meego.com/devices/netbook/installing-meego-netbook/windows-instructions&lt;/a&gt; \n\nSetup Procedure: \n\n 1. Boot from the stick to the Metro interface and then exit it by pressing Alt+F4. \n\n 2. Access Setup/Quicksetup via the JWM menu and complete the first-run settings as usual. \n\n 3. If Xorg wizard kicks in at any point complete it. \n\n 4. If you are using an LCD display, launch Fontwizard from the JWM/desktop menu, tick all boxes &amp; then click on apply. Restart X. \n\n N/B By default the Cups service is disabled. Enable it if and when you wish to print. \n\nFlash &amp; HTML5 players: \n\n Please note that flash 11-11.2.202.341 is already installed and that Chromium has HTML5 capability. \n Many sites are in the process of changing over to HTML5 with its superior quality and some have already done so. YouTube is in transition but you can visit their home page and opt to prefer HTML5 over flash when possible. I assume that opting to do so sets a persistent cookie. The bottom line is that you still need flash for both YouTube and YTinstant. By default flash is enabled. \n\n Ted.com already appears to have changed over and whilst it is o/k with Chrome it will not work with Chromium if flash is enabled. In Chromium therefore I have set a bookmark to Ã¢â‚¬Å“about:pluginsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ so that you can easily disable and then re-enable flash to use that site or any others that prove problematic. \n There is a tile for Ted.com on the metro interface and also a tile to access the flash plugin. Press F11 to toggle access to the bookmarks bar or use the tile. \n If you intend to launch TED.com disable flash first. Having done so, exit the browser with Alt+F4, then re-launch it with the LH Windows key. You can then click on the TED tile to access their excellent HTML5 videos. \n\nTip: \n If you forget whether you have flash enabled or not just use the metro tile to visit the Puppy forum home page. If the advert banner in the top right hand corner is static rather than animated then flash is disabled. \n\nFinal Thoughts: \n\n This Pup is firmly in the Ã¢â‚¬Å“toyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ category but is fast in either mode and very user friendly. Please test and flag up any issues. \n\n The traditional desktop mode should satisfy old greys such as myself but equally when switched to metro mode it should keep the grandchildren happy. \n\n A brief slideshow follows: \n Press F11 then use your left &amp; right arrow keys to move between slides Ã¢â‚¬â€œ requires Chrome/Chromium/Firefox.  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://docs.google.co","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:94adcf6de6daf56c61575b34bdff776f89d2ddfe","amp;dn":"Puppy_Linux_Blue_Pup_archive","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"94adcf6de6daf56c61575b34bdff776f89d2ddfe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,173,207,109,230,218,245,108,97,87,91,52,189,255,119,111,137,210,221,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
