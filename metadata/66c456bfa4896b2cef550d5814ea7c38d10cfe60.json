Accompanying them is scientist, Rachel Scott. After a few months in the Arctic while Scott is on the ice doing research, some men attack them. They get back to the ship and the Commander, Tom Chandler asks the doctor what's going on. She says that a deadly disease broke out a few months ago. At first, they thought it was contained but they had no cure. They felt that the cure was in the Arctic which why she's here. But she has since received word that it has now spread to most of the globe. Chandler tries to call the President but learns the President and Vice President are dead and the US government might not have long to survive. The current President tells him that the Nathan James was not in the hot zone so he and his crew are OK. But now it's up to them to safeguard Scott because she holds the key to the planet's survival.\r\n\r\n\r\n**********************************************************************************\r\n\r\n****-Note About DvD-**** \r\n\r\nNothing has been added nor taken away it is as I received it. If there are no subs in your required language it is because there were none on the DvD and I was unable to procure a DvD with those Subs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIngenting har lagts till eller tagits bort Ã¤r det som jag fick den.
