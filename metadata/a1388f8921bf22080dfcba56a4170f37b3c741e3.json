Although, hang on, that system means starting the whole series with the least funny sketch. Might need to rethink that. OK, it's a new show filled with sketches written and performed by John Finnemore, but now no longer arranged in strict order of funniness. Also, he's cut the sketch that would have gone first.\n\n\nJohn Finnemore's Souvenir Programme is written by and stars John Finnemore. It also features Carrie Quinlan (The News Quiz, The Late Edition), Lawry Lewin (The Life &amp; Times of Vivienne Vyle, Horrible Histories) and Simon Kane (Six Impossible Things).\n\nProducer: Ed Morrish.\n\nEnjoy this Torrent!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a1388f8921bf22080dfcba56a4170f37b3c741e3","amp;dn":"John+Finnimore%5C%27s+Souvenir+Programme","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a1388f8921bf22080dfcba56a4170f37b3c741e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,56,143,137,33,191,34,8,13,252,186,86,164,23,15,55,179,199,65,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
