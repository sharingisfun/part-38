Each one of them hoped to be the last to leave. Now, theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re just hoping to stay alive, because one of them isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t who he seems, and the island isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t as deserted as it appears. The men will be slaughtered. The women will be kept alive as captives. And before it is over, the survivors will turn on each other. Night is falling, the creatures are coming, and rescue is so very far awayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\nUnabridged\nRead by Maynard McKillen\nRuntime 7 Hours and 35 Minutes\n\n\n-----------------------------------------\n\nVisit us for this and loads more:\n\nwww.audiobookvault.com\n\n-----------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ac163be4ab890e137e760bc10ce06a292e9b64b","amp;dn":"Castaways++Brian+Keene","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ac163be4ab890e137e760bc10ce06a292e9b64b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,193,99,190,74,184,144,225,55,231,96,188,16,206,6,162,146,233,182,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
