All ideas and insights develop within the context of the work of other researchers, thinkers, and writers. This book is no exception, and while it is not meant to be an academic textbook, it nonetheless draws on and references the work of other scholars. I have followed the convention of trade books and do not footnote within the text; I direct you to the Notes at the end, where my sources are cited. You will find a Bibliography there as well, offering direction for follow-up reading where a topic or idea interests you.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f339bde4d51848633f737ff7f82dc848ea839609","amp;dn":"Power+Talk+-+Using+Language+to+Build+Authority+and+Influence+%28Ma","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f339bde4d51848633f737ff7f82dc848ea839609","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,57,189,228,213,24,72,99,63,115,127,247,248,45,200,72,234,131,150,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
