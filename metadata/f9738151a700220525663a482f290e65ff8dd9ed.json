Freedman, &quot;Wrong: Why experts keep failing us--and how to know when not to trust them *Scientists, finance wizards, doctors, relationship gurus, celebrity CEOs, ... consultants, health officials and more&quot;\nEnglish | ISBN: 0316023787 | 2010 | EPUB/MOBI | 304 pages | 1 MB\n\nOur investments are devastated, obesity is epidemic, test scores are in decline, blue-chip companies circle the drain, and popular medications turn out to be ineffective and even dangerous. What happened? Didn't we listen to the scientists, economists and other experts who promised us that if we followed their advice all would be well?\n\nActually, those experts are a big reason we're in this mess. And, according to acclaimed business and science writer David H. Freedman, such expert counsel usually turns out to be wrong--often wildly so. Wrong reveals the dangerously distorted ways experts come up with their advice, and why the most heavily flawed conclusions end up getting the most attention-all the more so in the online era. But there's hope: Wrong spells out the means by which every individual and organization can do a better job of unearthing the crucial bits of right within a vast avalanche of misleading pronouncements.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9738151a700220525663a482f290e65ff8dd9ed","amp;dn":"Wrong%3A+Why+experts+keep+failing+us","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9738151a700220525663a482f290e65ff8dd9ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,115,129,81,167,0,34,5,37,102,58,72,47,41,14,101,255,141,217,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
