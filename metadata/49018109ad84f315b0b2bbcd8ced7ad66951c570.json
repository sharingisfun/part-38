Duel rival wizards and wade into hordes of deadly beasts in your quest to restore 50 shattered worlds. At your disposal is an impressive arsenal of devastating spells. Summon lighting storms, meteors, raise the dead to fight for you and, of course, cast the classic fireball spell, and that is only the beginning!
