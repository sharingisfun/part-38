Ever sloshed, these two &quot;heroes&quot; stumble through decapitations and amputations of every variety, delirium tremens and self-cannibalism, in a never-ending cycle of comical misery, pain and death. But in the great tradition of comic-book characters, they come alive again ready for their next horrific exit. The two also recite poetry: world-weary reflections on love, death, drunkenness and the futility of life. Even the fish are alienated, sighing &quot;the baited hook, a tired clichÃ¢â‚¬Å¡,&quot; as Gabby casts his fishing line into the water. Millionaire's strange and engaging comics style alternates between an almost sincere romanticism and a wholly unpredictable cartoonism. He'll devote a series of panels to beautifully rendered riverboats, while the next entries feature a roving band of ear mites who take up residence in Drinky-Crow's rotted, sun-baked skull and ask him to describe the afterlife (&quot;like being strapped to a tornado of pain,&quot; he responds). The black and white drawings are impressive, with gorgeously rendered sailing ships, nostalgic seascapes and drawings in the style of 19th-century German prints. Designed by the esteemed Chip Kidd, this is a must-read for comics fans.\n\n136 pages\n\nPublished by Fantagraphics 2000","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f37856e328df119b0e8c03b90294e92cbce9747","amp;dn":"Tony+Millionare%3A+Maakies+%28Fantagraphics%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f37856e328df119b0e8c03b90294e92cbce9747","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,55,133,110,50,141,241,25,176,232,192,59,144,41,78,146,203,206,151,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
