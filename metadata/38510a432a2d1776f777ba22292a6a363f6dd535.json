The song was released as the first physical single from the album in March 2006.\n\nIn February 11, 2007, it won three Grammy Awards in the categories of Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal. \n\nThe music video for &quot;Not Ready to Make Nice&quot;, which was directed by the acclaimed British director Sophie Muller, uses the contrast of dark and white colors. The video starts with a scene of Natalie painting the white clothes of the other two band members, Martie and Emily, with black paint, which symbolizes the boycott of the band. Then, Natalie is seen wearing a black dress with her hands on a puddle of black paint. In another scene, the band members are sitting in a chair and when Natalie gets up to say something, Martie and Emily pull her back in to the chair. Then, Natalie and the other Dixie Chicks are seen in an environment that looks like a classroom and the teacher sends Natalie to write &quot;To talk without thinking is to shoot without aiming&quot; on the blackboard. On the final scenes of the video, Natalie is seen in front of three doctors in what appears to be a mental institution, trying to escape from them.\n\nThe music video of the song broke the record as the longest run at #1 on VH1's VSpot Top 20 Countdown spending 14 weeks at the top, 13 of them consecutive. The video also became the second ever to retire on the show on 7 October 2006, when it was at #9 on the countdown. In December 2006, it was named one of the best videos of the year by VH1. &quot;Not Ready to Make Nice&quot; was ranked #36 on CMT's 100 Greatest Videos.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:38510a432a2d1776f777ba22292a6a363f6dd535","amp;dn":"Dixie+Chicks+-+Not+Ready+To+Make+Nice","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"38510a432a2d1776f777ba22292a6a363f6dd535","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,81,10,67,42,45,23,118,247,119,186,34,41,42,106,54,63,109,213,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
