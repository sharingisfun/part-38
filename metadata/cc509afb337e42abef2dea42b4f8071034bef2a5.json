Among them, in the horde of Thoz, lives a unique child with black skin, rejected by his own. When the tribeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s elder announces his departure for Santiago de Cuba, the domain of the ancient Gods, the childÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fate is sealed: the outcast will be put to death upon the ElderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s return. But the elder doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t return... So the Black Child resolves to go looking for him, far from suspecting that his journey will uncover the remains of twentieth century civilisation...\n\nenjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc509afb337e42abef2dea42b4f8071034bef2a5","amp;dn":"NiourK+%231+-+%232+%282012%29+%28Alice%29cbz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc509afb337e42abef2dea42b4f8071034bef2a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,80,154,251,51,126,66,171,239,45,234,66,180,248,7,16,52,190,242,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
