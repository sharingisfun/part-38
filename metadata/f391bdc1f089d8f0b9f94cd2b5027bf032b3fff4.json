Additional recognition came after a European tour with Moonspell and later with the Gathering and Seigmen. With the rest of Lacuna Coil's lineup in place -- courtesy of Andrea Ferro (vocals), Cristiano Migliore (guitars), Marco Coti Zelati (bass), and Christiano Mozzati (drums) -- the band's first full-length, In a Reverie, was issued in 1999. The Halflife EP appeared in 2000, and their next LP, Unleashed Memories, followed in spring 2001.\n\n\n\nFormat: Mp3\nBitrate: 320 CBR\nContains: Album Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n\n\n01.Fragile\n02.To The Edge\n03.Our Truth\n04.Within Me\n05.Devoted\n06.You Create\n07.What I See\n08.Fragments Of Faith\n09.Closer\n10.In Visible Light\n11.The Game\n12.Without Fear\n13.Enjoy The Silence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n             ****Support The Artists &amp; Buy It If You Like It.****\n\n\n                 ****Enjoy &amp; Please Don\\'t Forget To Seed!****\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f391bdc1f089d8f0b9f94cd2b5027bf032b3fff4","amp;dn":"Lacuna+Coil+-+Karmacode+%5B2006%5D+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f391bdc1f089d8f0b9f94cd2b5027bf032b3fff4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,145,189,193,240,137,216,240,185,249,76,210,181,2,123,240,50,179,255,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
