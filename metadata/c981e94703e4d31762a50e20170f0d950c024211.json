He is best known for his membership as the guitarist and primary songwriter within The Band.[2] He was ranked 78th in Rolling Stone magazineÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s list of the 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time.[3] The Band has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame[4] and the Canadian Music Hall of Fame.[5] As a songwriter Robertson is responsible for such classics as &quot;The Weight&quot;, &quot;The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down&quot;, &quot;Up On Cripple Creek&quot;, &quot;Broken Arrow&quot; and &quot;Somewhere Down the Crazy River&quot;, and has been inducted into the Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRobbie Robertson 1987\n\n\nRobbie Robertson is the self-titled solo debut by Robbie Robertson, released in 1987. The album won the Juno Award for &quot;Album of the Year&quot;, and producers Lanois and Robertson won the &quot;Producer of the Year&quot; Juno award, both in 1989 as there were no Juno Awards held in 1988.\n\nThe album is notable for the contributions from the members of U2 and Peter Gabriel, both of who were also working with producer Daniel Lanois at the time. U2 was recording The Joshua Tree and Gabriel was recording So. U2's contribution is heard in the song &quot;Sweet Fire of Love&quot; which is a duet of sorts between Robertson and U2 lead singer Bono. The other track featuring U2 is &quot;Testimony&quot;, again with vocals from Bono. Gabriel's contributions are heard on the song &quot;Fallen Angel&quot;, which was dedicated to Robertson's former Band bandmate Richard Manuel, and &quot;Broken Arrow&quot; which reverberates with Gabriel's signature Rhodes electric piano. In addition, Tony Levin and Manu KatchÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©, who were recording with Gabriel, are featured prominently on this record. (The album notes give Ashcombe House, London as a recording venue: this should read Ashcombe House, Bath, Peter Gabriel's home and recording studio at the time the album was recorded).\n\n\nTracks:\n\n\n1.\t&quot;Fallen Angel&quot; (Robertson, Martin Page) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:52\n2.\t&quot;Showdown at Big Sky&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:43\n3.\t&quot;Broken Arrow&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:17\n4.\t&quot;Sweet Fire of Love&quot; (Robertson, U2) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:08\n5.\t&quot;American Roulette&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:46\n6.\t&quot;Somewhere Down the Crazy River&quot; (Robertson, Martin Page) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:44\n7.\t&quot;Hell's Half Acre&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:45\n8.\t&quot;Sonny Got Caught in the Moonlight&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:45\n9.\t&quot;Testimony&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:45\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStoryville 1991\n\n\nStoryville is Robbie Robertson's second solo album.
