If you are a traditionalist who wants nothing but Pakistani music, stay away. This album is soaked in ambient electronic guitar noises and some of Khan's most out-of-the-tradition singing. These experiments are not to be confused with lots of the electro-noodling, however. Both artists were devoted to their gods and their music, and it shows in the potency of these tracks. Brook seems to have been a natural match for Nusrat and has drawn out an unusual performance that probably fulfills the ideas that were only hinted at in their first collaboration, Musst Musst.\n\nTracks\n01- My Heart, My Life\n02- Intoxicated\n03- Lament\n04- My Comfort Remains\n05- Longing\n06- Sweet Pain\n07- Night Song\n08- Crest\n\nArtwork, EAC log and CUE sheet included\n\nFormat: FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://flac.sourceforge.net/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://flac.sourceforge.net/index.html&lt;/a&gt; \n\nEnjoy, seed and inhale!\n\nLegalise it!\n\nPastafari Cubensis &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/pastafari/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/pastafari/&lt;/a&gt;\nProud Member of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://venganza.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://venganza.org&lt;/a&gt;\n\nYou too can search for evidence the Flying Spaghetti Monster is the Lord and Master of the Universe  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://setiathome.berkeley.edu&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://setiathome.berkeley.edu&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:89e3d0f949ef95da1bd76f94b43a1ab441e02e21","amp;dn":"Nusrat+Fateh+Ali+Khan+-+Night+Song+%5BFLAC%5D+TQMP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"89e3d0f949ef95da1bd76f94b43a1ab441e02e21","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,227,208,249,73,239,149,218,27,215,111,148,180,58,26,180,65,224,46,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
