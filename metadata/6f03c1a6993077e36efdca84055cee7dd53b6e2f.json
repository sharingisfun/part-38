You do not see these options when you are logged in as an author or editor, only as an administration. The settings available in the WordPress admin area allow you to do everything from change the name of the site to determine how comment moderation should work or what the url structure of your site should look like. In this short course, we will go over and explain all of the major settings that control WordPress. This course aims to help someone become a WordPress Power User, one who can use the admin area to manage site content, customization and general settings of a WordPress site.
