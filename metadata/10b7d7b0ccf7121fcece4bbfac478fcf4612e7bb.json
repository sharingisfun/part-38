Unlike normal wars however, the methods of combat used are based on the power of fashion instead of military might, a totally unorthodox style that generally involves the vixens running around topless or even totally naked during battle and the mouse general being defeated due to her &quot;inadequacies&quot; in most cases as a result. \n\n\nMore info via: http://furry.wikia.com/wiki/Tank_Vixens\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:10b7d7b0ccf7121fcece4bbfac478fcf4612e7bb","amp;dn":"%5Bm4rf%5D+Tank+Vixens+%5BFUR%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"10b7d7b0ccf7121fcece4bbfac478fcf4612e7bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,183,215,176,204,247,18,31,206,206,75,191,172,71,143,207,70,18,231,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
