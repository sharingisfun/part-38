Description:\n-----------------\nBlack Mesa (formerly Black Mesa: Source) is a Half-Life 2 total \nconversion remaking of Valve Software's award-winning PC game, \nHalf-Life.\n\nUtilizing the Source engine, Black Mesa will reintroduce the player \nas Doctor Gordon Freeman, along with the original cast of memorable \ncharacters and environments seen in Half-Life. Black Mesa was built \nand founded on the basis that Half-Life: Source didn't fully live up \nto the potential of a Source engine port of Half-Life. As such, Black \nMesa was founded to fully reconstruct the Half-Life universe utilizing \nSource to its fullest potential in terms of art detail, level sizes \nand code features. It should be noted that the project is being built \nfrom the ground up and is not a simple port of Half Life maps and \nmodels into the Source Engine. The idea is to remake the storyline \nused in Half Life into a new polished Source Engine version with new \nmodels, maps, soundtrack, voice acting and textures. \n\nII.
