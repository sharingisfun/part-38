I am glad I finally got around to this one though.  It has become one of my favorites.\n\n\n\nIn an act of heroism and self-sacrifice, Anderson Rawn's sister saved him from the destruction of their tiny mining colony, but her actions condemned the 13-year-old to 10 years of crushing loneliness on the hyperspace journey to a new home. Using electronics and desperation, Anderson creates a family to keep him company, but family isn't always a blessing. When Anderson finally arrives, C.J. Poulson greets him with curiosity and awe, because anyone who can survive a holocaust and reinvent holo-science is going to be a legend and right up C.J.'s alley. But the more C.J. investigates how Anderson endured the last 10 years, the deeper he is drawn into a truly dangerous fantasy, one that offers the key to Anderson's salvation - and his destruction.\n\nIn spite of his best intentions, C.J. canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t resist the terribly seductive Anderson. Their attraction threatens to destroy them, because the heart of a man who can survive the destruction of his people and retain his sense of self holds a solid core of alpha male that will not be denied","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9cb95909b1d798f0297a5280647ce34c2ddb51cd","amp;dn":"Amy+Lane+-+A+Solid+Core+of+Alpha","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9cb95909b1d798f0297a5280647ce34c2ddb51cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,185,89,9,177,215,152,240,41,122,82,128,100,124,227,76,45,219,81,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
