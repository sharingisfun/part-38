The \ncontrol is definitely a plus of this game -- the left stick on the \npad controls the movement of the main character, the right stick \noperates the chosen weapon or tool and points it in whichever \ndirection you choose. Extensive use of the two sticks is necessary \nthroughout the game for everything from swimming to rowing a boat. \n\n\nRelease date: June 22, 1999\nPlatform: PlayStation\n\n*Tested and works in ePSXe Emulator","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e64c28ac7c2391ad4d3ff746a738d7352fb62b9","amp;dn":"Ape+Escape+PS1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e64c28ac7c2391ad4d3ff746a738d7352fb62b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,100,194,138,199,194,57,26,212,211,255,116,106,115,141,115,82,251,98,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
