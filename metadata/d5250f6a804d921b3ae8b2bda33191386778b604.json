Supposedly, the sessions for this album were cut between 1971 and 1973 but the Riverman Records reissue OBI strip dates Silent Passage at 1975. Artists as diverse as Tom Rush, Billy Joe Shaver and Emmylou Harris have covered CarpenterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s material.\n\nBob CarpenterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rustic, gritty vocals will probably be an acquired taste but donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t let this deter you from listening to this fine album. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a certain spirtual vibe that cloaks Silent Passage, also, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not the cheeriest record but not many country-rock albums are. The lyrics usually deal with depression, isolation, loss and the occasional religious overtone but these themes are common among many early 70s country rock/Americana/singer songwriter releases. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s closest cousin is probably Bob MartinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s classic Midwest Farm Disaster.\n\nKey tracks are the great, eerie Americana of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Gypsy Boy,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a spiritual highlight titled Ã¢â‚¬Å“Morning Train,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the desolate Ã¢â‚¬Å“Down Along the Border,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the depressing but strangely optimistic Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Believer.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Some tracks such as Ã¢â‚¬Å“Miracle ManÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Old FriendsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ offer up a more commerical rock sound while Ã¢â‚¬Å“First LightÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a folk gem with strings and organ.\n\nOverall this is a very good, overlooked LP with many strengths. A quiet gem for the folk-rock and country-rock fans.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d5250f6a804d921b3ae8b2bda33191386778b604","amp;dn":"Bob+Carpenter+-+Silent+Passage+%5B1975%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d5250f6a804d921b3ae8b2bda33191386778b604","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,37,15,106,128,77,146,27,58,232,178,189,163,49,145,56,103,120,182,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
