The DVD contains footage from two concerts held during the European tour which followed the release of the studio album Classic Diamonds. The album was a special project for Doro Pesch, who revised and re-arranged some of her songs for the Classic Night Orchestra, a 30-elements symphonic orchestra. A smaller ensemble of the orchestra accompanied Doro and her usual touring musicians on tour, but the full orchestra was on stage in August 2004 at Wacken Open Air for a strictly acoustic set, an unusual performance for the largest European heavy metal festival. Special guests of the night were former-Iron Maiden singer Blaze Bayley and guitarist Chris Caffery (Savatage, Trans-Siberian Orchestra).\n\nAs an extra, the DVD features also a concert held in Cologne, Germany, where Doro performed her usual heavy metal repertoire and which the German TV show Rockpalast broadcasted on 17 October 2004.\n\nTracklist:\n01.
