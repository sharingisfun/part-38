It is implied that the title of the manga is derived from the &quot;good endings&quot; that are achieved in harem visual novels. Although the story was once concluded in the one shot version, the full version includes identical characters and settings.\n\nInfo Source: MyAnimeList\nDownload Source: Manga Traders","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba07e409acdb4c7d28c60874329c6a6223c8e053","amp;dn":"GE%3A+Good+Ending+-+Vol.+03","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba07e409acdb4c7d28c60874329c6a6223c8e053","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,7,228,9,172,219,76,125,40,198,8,116,50,156,106,98,35,200,224,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
