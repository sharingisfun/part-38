A Perfectly Clear world.\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“This image was corrected with Perfectly Clear. it looks like the one that I worked on using Photoshop Ã¢â‚¬â€ it took over 10 minutes in Photoshop, and many adjustments Ã¢â‚¬â€ brighten, sharpen, change the contrast and other tweaks Ã¢â‚¬â€ and only 1 click and instant with Perfectly Clear!Ã¢â‚¬Å“\n-Carl Whitt, Pro Photographer\nThe Plugin displays for you the Ã¢â‚¬ËœbeforeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and Ã¢â‚¬Ëœafter Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ photo so you can easily determine if you want to fine tune any of them. And hereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the good news. Fine tuning a Perfectly Clear photo is fun and instant. HereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s why. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the only system where all corrections function independently. Therefore the magic is youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re tweaking your photos with independent controls. This means that if, for example, you want to tweak the exposure you wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t mess up the photoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vibrancy, or if you want to tweak the sharpness you wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t affect the color etc. Experience the magic of independent controls Ã¢â‚¬â€œ fine tuning photos in seconds. You can also quickly select another preset to apply automatically to your photo or create your own custom one.\nSo Perfectly Clear Photoshop Plug-in is all about quick, easy and fast Ã¢â‚¬â€œ itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all about saving vast amounts of time and putting the fun, and yes profit, back into photography Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also about getting high quality photos Ã¢â‚¬â€œ superior photos to any other method. The key is that Perfectly Clear Ã¢â‚¬ËœcorrectsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ photos Ã¢â‚¬â€œ it doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Ã¢â‚¬ËœenhanceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ photos. A corrected photo is superior to an Ã¢â‚¬Å“enhancedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ photo, and not by a little but by a lot, and hereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s why.\n\nPerfectly Clear means Superior Quality Photos\nThere are multiple reasons why a Perfectly Clear photo is superior to other photos. Perfectly Clear reproduces what the eye sees by Ã¢â‚¬Å“adding backÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ the eye function that a camera lacks. By better reproducing what the eye sees, Perfectly Clear photos elicit enthusiastic responses from participants, audiences and photographers alike. Photography is the art of eliciting emotion, and Perfectly Clear does it best.\n&quot;Cameras donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t match human vision. They donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t perceive and record depth and dimension information. And they donÃ‚Â¹t record anywhere near as much &quot;metadata&quot; as we associate with our visual memories. Rising to these capabilities is a huge challenge. But ultimately, whether we realize it or not, we as users expect nothing less from our cameras than to equal what we see with our eyes, and we wonÃ‚Â¹t be satisfied until we get it. In this dawning age of images-as-language, the integrity of visual information, how well it reproduces our perception of reality, and the richness of context associated with it (who, what, when, where and why) are what determines the value of that visual information.\n-Alexis Gerard, author of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Going VisualÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, and co-founder of 6Sight imaging conferences.&quot;\nThis is only possible because Perfectly Clear applies 10 patented and patent pending processes in a very precise and rigorous way, replicating how the eye gathers light and overcoming the 15 ways your camera distorts your photos. Whether a camera is expensive or off the shelf, it still embodies limitations such as the single aperture which need to be overcome. Perfectly Clear makes its corrections while avoiding the pitfalls that all other editing and enhancement software introduce. And Perfectly Clear ensures quality through the auto Ã¢â‚¬â€œ correction applying a comprehensive suite of 12 corrections, yet it is Ã¢â‚¬ËœsmartÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ enough to only apply the ones that a particular photo needs to be improved.\nQuality award winning photos demands the three things Perfect Photos need: accurate colors, perfect exposure emulating the human eye and preservation of color nuances and details.\n\n\n================\n[INSTALL NOTES:]\n================\n\n1.
