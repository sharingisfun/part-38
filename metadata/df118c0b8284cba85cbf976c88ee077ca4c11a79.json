Digitally remastered glam-rock classic of the final performance given at London's Hammersmith Odeon in 1973.\nDavid Bowie's as his most famous alter ego is one of the more legendary shows in the rock canon, but aficionados have frequently held this audio document, as recorded by Dylan/Monterey Pop documentary director D. A. Pennebaker, in somewhat low regard. Of course, the wonderful Ziggy Stardust album was such a pristine production that any live reproduction suffers in comparison, but fans may notice a significant improvement three decades later.\nWhether time has made the closer-to-garage-rock ethos of the live Spiders from Mars play better or whether it just sounds better is hard to say. But this 30th anniversary version does sound a whole lot better than all previous versions. Producer Terry Visconti has remastered what was once murk into something that sounds crisp and clear. \nThe new packaging is lovely and the entire concert--incidental intro music and all--is documented for the first time. Pity the rights couldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t be re-secured to include Jeff BeckÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s long-deleted appearance on &quot;Jean Genie,&quot; and Jacque Brel's &quot;My Death&quot; is still a tad melodramatic. But you also get most of the great Ziggy tunes, a few earlier classics, several from the then-unreleased Aladdin Sane, a terrific &quot;All the Young Dudes,&quot; and perhaps the best cover ever of the Velvet Underground's &quot;White Light/White Heat.&quot;\n\n\nDisc 01\n\n[01] Intro\n[02] Hang On To Yourself\n[03] Ziggy Stardust\n[04] Watch That Man\n[05] Wild Eyed Boy From Freecloud\n[06] All The Young Dudes\n[07] Oh!
