On 13-14 November 1990 that madness came to Aramoana, a small New Zealand seaside village. It came in the form of a lone gunman with a high-powered semi-automatic rifle. As he stalked his victims the terrified and confused residents were trapped in the village for 24 hours while a handful of under-resourced and underarmed local policeman risked their lives trying to find him and save the survivors. By dawn 13 people lay dead. This is a true story. Director: Robert Sarkies Stars: Karl Urban, Matthew Sunderland, Lois Lawn \n\nFrom New Zealand, in English\n\nEnglish subtitles included in folder.\n\nPlease seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e470e912bf2e89ed52f78e0c3bb4f6aa977bbe4","amp;dn":"Out+of+the+Blue++%282006%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e470e912bf2e89ed52f78e0c3bb4f6aa977bbe4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,71,14,145,43,242,232,158,213,47,120,224,195,187,79,106,169,119,187,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
