This means that a BDRips are much closer to the Original quality than the BRRips.\nMZON3 encodes are BDRips. Better quality and no more faults in the encodes.\n\nx264 10bit Video?\n10bit encodes are the latest innovation from the x264 Devs. 10bit reduces quality loss and has the ability to hold more bitrate/quality compared to the x264/XviD alone. Plus, with the Higher Quality it even reduces the file size. MZON3 encodes will be on x264 10bit because we admire quality and size in the perfect combination.\n\nAAC Audio?\nCompared to the AC3/MP3, AAC delivers the ultimate audio experience.
