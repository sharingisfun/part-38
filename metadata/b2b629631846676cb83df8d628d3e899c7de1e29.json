I See Your Face Before Me \t \n2. If There Is Someone Lovelier Than You \t \n3. Little Melonae \t \n4. Rise 'N' Shine \t\n5. By The Numbers *\n\n\n\nRecorded in Hackensack, NJ on March 26, 1958\n\n\n\nPersonnel:\n\nJohn Coltrane, tenor saxophone\nRed Garland,  piano\nPaul Chambers,  bass\nArt Taylor, drums\n\n\n\n&quot;Settin' The Pace&quot; provides more than worthwhile material from a period of John Coltrane's career when the astonishing burst of creativity that would stay with him to the end was just on the point of realisation.\n\nThe rhythm section here has appeared with on several Prestige releases as the Red Garland Trio. Both Garland and Chambers have played with Coltrane in the Miles Davis Quintet, and Art Taylor did some work with Davis as well.  \n\nThis is Coltrane in a relaxed bop mode, making some swinging, relaxed jazz. Anyone who likes the mainstream jazz of the '50s, or Miles' music of that time, or Coltrane fans who want to hear their idol in an easygoing context, should pick this up. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a great one.\n\nFor this RVG edition, a fifth track, &quot;By The Numbers&quot;, a blues based jam is also included.\n\n\n \nStraight, no chaser.\n:)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b2b629631846676cb83df8d628d3e899c7de1e29","amp;dn":"John+Coltrane+-+Settin%27+The+Pace+1958+%2F+2008","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b2b629631846676cb83df8d628d3e899c7de1e29","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,182,41,99,24,70,103,108,184,61,248,214,40,211,232,153,199,222,30,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
