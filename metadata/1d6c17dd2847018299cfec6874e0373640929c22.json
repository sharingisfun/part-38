Mike Fallon is smooth, suave, and sexy, and a genius at the subtle art of making an assassination look like one of those unfortunate, all-too-frequent accidents. Handsome as James Bond, lethal as Carlos the Jackal, discrete as an air bubble to the heart. Broken neck in the shower? Poor guy probably slipped on the soap. Collect for the first time, Accident Man features four darkly humorous tales of sex, revenge, brutal violence, and people drowning in the bath.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d6c17dd2847018299cfec6874e0373640929c22","amp;dn":"The_Complete_Accident_Man_%282014%29_%28Digital%29_%28DR_%26amp%3B_Quinch-Empi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d6c17dd2847018299cfec6874e0373640929c22","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,108,23,221,40,71,1,130,153,207,236,104,116,224,55,54,64,146,156,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
