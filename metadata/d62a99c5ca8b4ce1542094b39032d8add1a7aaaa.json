This classic thriller is an allegory of the nazis early rise to power in Germany and their future intentions. Censored by the Nazis government and not seen in its full form until many years later. The Testament of Dr. Mabuse (1933) deals with the themes of free will, genius, madness, and power. The Dr. Mabuse character foreshadows the great James Bond villains of Dr. No, Goldfinger, and Ernest Blofeld. Would be the final film that director Fritz Lang would do in Germany for many years until 1960 for his final film, The 1000 Eyes of Dr. Mabuse.\n\nGerman with English and French subtitles, Xvid (Perian), 568 ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€ 472, Millions, MPEG Layer 3, Stereo, 48.000 kHz, 912.33 kbits/s, 01:54:26.76","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d62a99c5ca8b4ce1542094b39032d8add1a7aaaa","amp;dn":"The+Testament+of+Dr+Mabuse+%28Fritz+Lang+1933%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d62a99c5ca8b4ce1542094b39032d8add1a7aaaa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,42,153,197,202,139,76,225,84,32,148,179,144,50,216,173,209,167,170,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
