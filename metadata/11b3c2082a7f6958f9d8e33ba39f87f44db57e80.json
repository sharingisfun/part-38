Buy and sell a list of popular drugs in different parts of the city while trying to make a buck or two. Buy low, sell high is the object of the game. That and not getting thrown out of a building for owing the loan shark money. Make sure to not get nicked by the pigs either, although I'm sure you will but at least you'll have a better chance of living if you do. Can't say the same for your dog as it seems likely that most cops all of a sudden fear for their lives when around most dogs regardless of anything, they usually shoot to kill. Sorry, got side tracked there. But this game is nothing less than iconic, one that every kid sitting in math class, bored, has surely played on their calculators. So enjoy this entertaining classic and remember; Don't piss off the loan shark and FUCK the police!\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nI will seed for as long as I have the game on my laptop and I ask anyone who downloads this file please seed at least until 5.000 ratio until the file has a good quantity of seeders. DON'T BE A DICK and hit &amp; run, please. Thank you.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nTUFFBUDZ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:11b3c2082a7f6958f9d8e33ba39f87f44db57e80","amp;dn":"Dope+Wars+2.2+-+TUFFBUDZ","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"11b3c2082a7f6958f9d8e33ba39f87f44db57e80","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,179,194,8,42,127,105,88,249,216,227,59,163,159,135,244,77,181,126,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
