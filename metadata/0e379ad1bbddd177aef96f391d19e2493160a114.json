As we already informed you last week, Space Engineers is entering into a temporary stabilization period where we will focus only on bug fixing and stabilization of the things that are already in the game. This is just a temporary transition period that will last for a few weeks. There are still many big and important features to be added, but first we want to make sure that the game is free of bugs and in a much more stable state.\n\nWhile waiting for the new features to come again in the game, it is a good time now, in case you havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t done already, to start using and experimenting with the mods that our modders have created. For this, we have prepared a small video for you with selected mods created in Space Engineers.\n\n\nList of Mods:\n- Industrial Thruster / Ecto Sage:\n- SektanSky v1.0 / Sektan:\n- Damageindicator / STORM:\n- SANCHINCORP(hoverbike) / sanchindachi666:\n- Automated Inventory Sorting / tyrsis:\n- Gesture Pack / Virakotxa:\n- Command Console Pack / kolt16:\n- S Guns Rocket Launcher / Sektan:\n- Docking Ring / Darth Biomech:\n- SANCHINCYBORGS / sanchindachi666:\n\nFeatures:\nThere are no new features this week\n\nFixes:\n- fixed major lag/freeze after drilling any asteroid\n- fixed groups disappearing when player left the server\n- fixed gatling gun damage is too soft\n- fixed assembler co-operate mod unchecking itself in multiplayer\n- fixed sound levels resetting after loading the map\n- fixed exploding piston after grinding it on small ship\n- fixed crash when exporting a model from the game\n- fixed crash when pasting grid with mods that you don't have\n- fixed advanced rotor staying in control panel\n- fixed various crashes when player was shooting\n- fixed mass blocks acting weird on dedicated server\n- fixed large reactor model being too small\n- fixed music issues when loading a map\n- fixed issues where player could not place a block\n- fixed performance drop issue with many turrets\n- fixed not being able to reload reloadable rocket launcher from the front\n- fixed emissivity for spotlight block\n- fixed issue with choosing reloadable rocket launcher in toolbar\n- fixed bullets having no visible particle effect\n- fixed placing light armor block under interior light on platform\n- fixed missing particle effect when player is welding\n- fixed remote control not working when ship flights over 250m away from the platform (DS)\n- fixed unfinished assemblers unmarked in production menu\n- fixed pressing &quot;Y&quot; shuts off all reactors regardless of ownership and sharing\n- fixed re-spawn ships not being deleted after logout\n- fixed connector keeps disconnecting\n- fixed missing aiming dot for missile launchers on large grids\n- fixed texture issue on small reactors\n- fixed question about ownership in re-spawn screen\n- fixed missing audio files message in logs\n- fixed joining issues when character died\n- fixed wrong size of the floating objects\n- fixed warheads exploding but doing no damage\n- fixed collision with attached parts in 3rd person view\n- fixed broken piston while deleting the top part in some situations (creative mode)\n- fixed master assembler pulling small amounts of material","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e379ad1bbddd177aef96f391d19e2493160a114","amp;dn":"Space+Engineers+v01.054.009+by+VIruz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e379ad1bbddd177aef96f391d19e2493160a114","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,55,154,209,187,221,209,119,174,249,111,57,29,25,226,73,49,96,161,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
