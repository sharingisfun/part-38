The use of these techniques often makes it preferable to conventional renderers which are provided standard with 3d software, and generally renders using these technique can appear more photo-realistic, as actual lighting effects are more realistically emulated.\nV-Ray is used in the film and video game industries.\nIt is also used extensively in making realistic 3D renderings for architecture.\n\n1. Install VRay\n2. Place the crack files in your max root, and cgauth.dll in your Chaos GroupV-Ray RT folder\n3.
