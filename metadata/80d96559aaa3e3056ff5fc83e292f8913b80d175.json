An average domestic garden becomes a perilous terrain, fraught with wasp attacks, skulking spiders, and bad-tempered millipedes. Will Nigel and the team make it back to their car to be re-enlarged in time? Or will they become lunch for a ravenous garden shrew? This fun documentary provides an adventure that will educate and entertain, making it perfect for the whole family. There are an estimated 8000 species in the average garden, so there's plenty to see.\n\n\n\n\n3)  Alligators \nNigel Marven travels to Florida to study the natural history of the American alligator. This film was made throughout 2001, one of the driest years in recent Florida history. As a result, it was a great time to see gators and study their habits. My crew captured incredible behaviour; courtship dances, fighting, cannibalism and nest construction. I managed to fulfil a dream by getting right up close to a mother gator tenderly taking her babies to the water in her mouth. At one point I donned a miniature camera on my forehead, so that we could film close-up views of the inside of a gator's open mouth. The end result was spectacular, but I nearly lost my arm in the process, my heart still hammers when I think about that.\n\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img526.imageshack.us/img526/5197/microsafariscreen0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img526.imageshack.us/img526/5197/microsafariscreen0.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img151.imageshack.us/img151/1528/microsafariscreen1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img151.imageshack.us/img151/1528/microsafariscreen1.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img99.imageshack.us/img99/432/microsafariscreen2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img99.imageshack.us/img99/432/microsafariscreen2.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img3.imageshack.us/img3/6757/microsafariscreen3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img3.imageshack.us/img3/6757/microsafariscreen3.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img805.imageshack.us/img805/999/microsafariscreen4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img805.imageshack.us/img805/999/microsafariscreen4.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img834.imageshack.us/img834/3409/microsafariscreen5.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img834.imageshack.us/img834/3409/microsafariscreen5.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img266.imageshack.us/img266/6110/microsafariscreen6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img266.imageshack.us/img266/6110/microsafariscreen6.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img641.imageshack.us/img641/9826/microsafariscreen7.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img641.imageshack.us/img641/9826/microsafariscreen7.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1538 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 416\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.731 (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 192 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 72.Mins\n * Number Of Parts: 4\n * Part Size: 896 MB\n * Source: DVD\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n * Part 2: 350 MB 25mins\n * Part 3 &amp;:4: 746 MB 50mins\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro_Safari:_Journey_to_the_Bugs&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro_Safari:_Journey_to_the_Bugs&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80d96559aaa3e3056ff5fc83e292f8913b80d175","amp;dn":"ITV+Micro+Safari+3of4+Alligators+XviD+AC3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80d96559aaa3e3056ff5fc83e292f8913b80d175","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,217,101,89,170,163,227,5,111,245,252,131,226,146,248,145,59,128,209,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
