Every war fought by our Army is covered in detail, with every major battle and strategic maneuver included: the American Revolution, the War of 1812, the Mexican War, the Civil War, the Spanish-American War, World Wars I and II, the Korean War, and the current Vietnam action. Even the periods between the wars were fraught with fights against the Indians, border skirmishes, defensive and offensive actions, Army reorganizations, peacetime dutiesâ€”all of which are fully and dramatically told here. In a concluding section the author reveals how the Army today is looking ahead &quot;where no man has ever trod.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56caf9c9b99c138bfbc8bd1aaefda1900a75f091","amp;dn":"A+Pictorial+History+of+the+US+Army+-+Colonial+Times+to+Vietnam","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56caf9c9b99c138bfbc8bd1aaefda1900a75f091","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,202,249,201,185,156,19,139,251,200,189,26,174,253,161,144,10,117,240,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
