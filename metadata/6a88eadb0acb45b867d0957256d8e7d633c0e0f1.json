The encyclopedia will adopt an inclusive editorial approach, encompassing fundamental and blue-sky science as well as those areas of research that have more immediate medical or commercial applications. The scope and structure of the work will reflect the multidimensional character of chemical biology, focusing in particular on the fundamental science of biological structures and systems, the use of chemical and biological techniques to elucidate that science, and the applications of this knowledge in areas as diverse as drug discovery, sensor technology, and catalysis.\nMajor topics areas covered in the encyclopedia:\n\nChemical Views of Biology\nBiomolecules within the Cell\nChemistry of Biological Processes and Systems\nChemical Biology of Cellular Compartments\nSynthetic Molecules as Tools for Chemical Biology\nTechnologies and Techniques in Chemical Biology\nApplications of Chemical Biology\n \n\nWiley Encyclopedia of Chemical Biology (WECB) is the only major reference resource devoted to the cross-disciplinary field of chemical biology. WECB is a first port of call for academic researchers and advanced students looking for timely and authoritative review-type information in this field. The articles in WECB, contributed by world-class authors, are designed to\n\nilluminate the crucial role of chemistry and chemical techniques in the life sciences\nsupport the information needs of researchers in the field of chemical biology\nprovide relevant and readily accessible information to upper-level students and to scientists in adjacent disciplines\nWECB is an evolving online database of information, combining the most useful features of traditional reference works and review journals in a compelling format designed to exploit the full potential of the online medium. Extensive linking to the primary literature and to other online resources further enhances the value of the encyclopedia as a gateway to the broader scientific literature.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a88eadb0acb45b867d0957256d8e7d633c0e0f1","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B2009%5D+Wiley+Encyclopedia+of+Chemical+Biology","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a88eadb0acb45b867d0957256d8e7d633c0e0f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,136,234,219,10,203,69,184,103,208,149,114,86,216,231,214,51,192,224,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
