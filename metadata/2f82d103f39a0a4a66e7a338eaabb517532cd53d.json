Born in England but active in the United States since the late 1950s, Morley has developed an intensely individual vision embracing, but never determined by, autobiography, politics, psychoanalysis, myth, the visual culture of his time and the limitless potential of paint. \n\nFilmed as Morley works in his distinctive manner on a spectacular new canvas, this documentary features the artist&amp;#039;s provocative reflections on his life, painting technique, influences and concerns. It also illustrates a wide range of his paintings from the earliest abstract works, through the painstakingly precise depictions of reproductions (on postcards, from travel brochures) of ships, contemporary scenes and Old Masters, to the catastrophe pictures of the 1970s. \n\nPaintings engaging with ancient cultures followed, and then works based on the cardboard cut-out aeroplane and boat kits which Morley has made since his youth. Most recently, he has returned to paintings of news photographs, exploring a striking and challenging new range of imagery.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------\n[img]http://img227.imageshack.us/img227/9946/malcolmmorleyscreen0iu5.th.jpg[/img] \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\nVideo Codec: XviD\nVideo Bitrate: 1423 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 704x400\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.760:1\nAudio Codec: MP3\nAudio Bitrate: 128kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime: 33:28\nPart Size: 373MB\nSubtitles: NO\nRipped by: Dentje\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1) Further Information \n* Publcisher Site\n\n2) Related Documentaries \n* Howard Hodgkins\n* Gillian Ayres\n* The Saatchi 100\n\n3) ed2k Links \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: http://docuwiki.net/index.php?title=Malcolm_Morley","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f82d103f39a0a4a66e7a338eaabb517532cd53d","amp;dn":"TheEYE.Malcolm.Morley.XviD.MP3.MVGroup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f82d103f39a0a4a66e7a338eaabb517532cd53d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,130,209,3,243,154,10,74,102,231,163,56,234,171,181,23,83,44,213,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
