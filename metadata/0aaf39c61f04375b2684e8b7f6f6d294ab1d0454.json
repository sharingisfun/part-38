It contains mostly files directly ripped from the game by me and converted to mp3 for your convenience.\nNotable mentions are:\n\nBioShock Infinite:\n\n- The Original Soundtrack was not ripped by me nor do I know who did it, so my thanks to you anon.\n\n- Black Gal (Ripped by me from the CD Prison Songs Volume 1)\n\n- Indian Love Call (Which was kindly ripped by a friend of mine from a vinyl)\n\nBurial at Sea Episode 1 &amp; 2:\n\n- La Vie en Rose (Intro Audio) by a fellow youtuber who did an awesome job at ripping the game audio. I Ã¢â‚¬Å“borrowedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ this montage of his because it is kind of cool. Check him out here :\n\n- Also I couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have recreated the La Vie en Rose (Orchestral Version) without his previous work.\n\n- Covers are also made by him, so all rights go to him as well. I remade the cover for episode 1 because I thought a bigger resolution would look better. I was too lazy to remake the cover for episode 2.\n\nIndexing and tagging courtesy of the BioShock Wikia and its associates.\n\nIf you have any constructive criticism on the order/tagging and/or the missing songs (if there are any) please make yourself known and I see to it that it will get fixed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0aaf39c61f04375b2684e8b7f6f6d294ab1d0454","amp;dn":"BioShock+Infinite+OST+-+Definitive+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0aaf39c61f04375b2684e8b7f6f6d294ab1d0454","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,175,57,198,31,4,55,91,38,132,232,183,246,246,210,148,171,29,4,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
