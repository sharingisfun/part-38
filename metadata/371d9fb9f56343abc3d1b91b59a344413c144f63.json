Or inherit a great fortune? We have already won an inheritance that is beyond our comprehension! An inheritance that transcends any quantitative measurement. In fact, it was set aside for us before the world began!\n\nEphesians is regarded by many as the loftiest pinnacle of the New Testament, and yet is also a practical manual for personal combat.\n\nJoin Chuck Missler as he explores Ephesians verse-by-verse.\n\n\nSeed long and Prosper with Blessings from our Father. I have prayed to The Father, Bless all that Seed Long.\n\nThis is in memory of my Mom who passed at 11:44 pm PST ON 1-25-2011. Now she knows.\n\n\nJESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.\n\nBorn of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.\n\n\nEphesians 5:11\n11 And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove (expose) them.\n\n                                             \n\n      :thankyou:    :thankyou:     Thank You JESUS  \n\n \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:371d9fb9f56343abc3d1b91b59a344413c144f63","amp;dn":"POtHS+-+Chuck+Missler+-+Ephesians+-+8+Session+%26amp%3B+Mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"371d9fb9f56343abc3d1b91b59a344413c144f63","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,29,159,185,245,99,67,171,195,209,185,27,89,163,68,65,60,20,79,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
