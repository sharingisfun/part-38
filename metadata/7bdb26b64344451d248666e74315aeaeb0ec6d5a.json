Frontman is Martin Thulin aka Menonita Rock, born in the State of Chihuahua, Northern Mexico in a Scandinavian Mennonite community called Nueva Escandinavia. \nMennonites are similar to Amish People, they live more or less isolated from the rest of the society with their own rules and traditions, in Mexico City you can see these natural blond Mexicans selling cheese on the street. \n\nHis parents were Mennonite hippies, something extremely uncommon at this point (and still is), who felt that the community were a little to small for their ideas, so they moved to Sweden and took the little child Martin with them. 10 years ago Martin moved back to Mexico City, where he still lives today.\nMenonita Rock is Los Fancy FreeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s debut album, released in Mexico through great Electro/House-label Noiselab. The music on Los Fancy-Free's Menonita Rock is some kind of raw, punkish electro pop.\n###################################################################################\n\nTrack List:\n\n01 The Naive Heat.mp3\n02 JAJAJA.mp3\n03 Fear.mp3\n04 Bona's Psychedelic Breakfast.mp3\n05 Beatle Suit &amp; Purple Boots.mp3\n06 Organs of Swing.mp3\n07 Eumerica.mp3\n08 Overture.mp3\n09 High Society.mp3\n\nWith Cover\n\nYear: 2008\nLabel: SILICONE CARNE (Mexico) mushroompillow.com (Spain) \nGenre: Americana / Punk / Regional Mexicana\n\nEnjoy it!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7bdb26b64344451d248666e74315aeaeb0ec6d5a","amp;dn":"Los+Fancy+Free+-+Never+Greens+Vol+1+-+320kps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7bdb26b64344451d248666e74315aeaeb0ec6d5a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,219,38,182,67,68,69,29,36,134,102,231,67,21,174,174,176,236,109,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
