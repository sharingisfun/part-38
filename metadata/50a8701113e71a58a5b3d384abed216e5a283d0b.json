Considered by some critics and fans to be a Dadaist, and known for blurring the borders between his stage persona and his &quot;true&quot; personality, Kaufman inflicted a brand of humor that was unique, sometimes slipping beyond comedy into performance art -- or mental illness. Here his format is the late-night talk show, and his sidekick is a marionette of his alter ego, obnoxious dive-lounge comedian Tony Clifton. Also included in the show: Kaufman reprises his Foreign Man character, impersonates Elvis Presley, seems to expose guest Dr. Alex Schorr as a fraud, and apparently has a genuine argument with his former girlfriend Elayne Boosler.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:50a8701113e71a58a5b3d384abed216e5a283d0b","amp;dn":"Soundstage%3A+The+Andy+Kaufman+Show+%281983%29+vhs+rip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"50a8701113e71a58a5b3d384abed216e5a283d0b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,168,112,17,19,231,26,88,165,179,211,132,171,237,33,110,90,40,61,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
