This new field has shown important breakthroughs on the basic understanding of physical mechanisms involving liquid interfaces, which led to applications in nanopatterning. It has also consequences in force microscopy imaging in liquid environment. The book proposes is a timely review of these various aspects. It is co-authored by 25 among the most prominent scientists in the field","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9bf6eedc439b4b1959853d47691ffc4dd592a29f","amp;dn":"Nanoscale+Liquid+Interfaces","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9bf6eedc439b4b1959853d47691ffc4dd592a29f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,246,238,220,67,155,75,25,89,133,61,71,105,31,252,77,213,146,162,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
