Treasure Of The Spirit\n10. Sacred River\n11. As Above\n\nThis is the kind of music that shows Chris Spheeris as being more than just a New Age artist but a visionary who is a master of thematic music. Each of the select tracks tells a story and you can imagine travelling to these various realms- hence the title &quot;Mystic Traveller&quot;. The beauty about each track is that exotic sounds, and real-life episodes help create an adventure that seems to take you on a journey far far away. From South America to China, to the Middle East, the Americas etc, one gets the feeling that this is an extraordinary soundtrack to an extraordinary adventure.\n\nThis music is best experienced through a good stereo system, as the sound is very well-recorded- spatial cues, instrument timbre, and tonality is right in your face, as if you were really there! This music is best enjoyed on a good stereo system as it is very well recorded- instrumental timbre, tonality, spatial cues are clearly delineated- the imaging is very wide and deep- almost like you are right there.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:73448bde80a61cd66b814375bef381329b632dda","amp;dn":"Chris+Spheeris+-+Mystic+Traveller+%28New+Age+%2F+World+Music+%29+%2B+Cov","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"73448bde80a61cd66b814375bef381329b632dda","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,68,139,222,128,166,28,214,107,129,67,117,190,243,129,50,155,99,45,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
