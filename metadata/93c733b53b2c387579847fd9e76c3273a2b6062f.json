One August morning, he disappeared. For fifteen years, everyone believed him dead. Instead, he was living in a little hotel near Frankfurt, with a wife and a young German son. Then, when the trains filled with waste departed from Naples, the past climbed on board. This is the story of a man who, while trying to kill a chestnut tree with a copper nail, was grabbed from behind by his past. And was forced to settle the score.\n\n\n\nGeneral Information\n\nRelease Date: 11-03-2011 Video Codec: XviD\nTheatre Date: 11-01-2010 Video Bitrate: 1399 kbps\nRetail Date: 04-13-2011 Video Aspect: 2.35:1\nRuntime: 105 mins Resolution: 640x272\n\nLanguages: Italian German Framerate: 24.000 fps\nSubtitles: English\n.\n\nDisks: CD1 700mb 37x20 Audio Codec: AC3\nCD2 700mb 38x20 Audio Format: CBR 448k 5.1\nDirected By: Claudio Cupellini\nGenre: Crime/Drama\nIMDb URL: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1521090/\nIMDb Rating: 7.1/10 (247 votes)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:93c733b53b2c387579847fd9e76c3273a2b6062f","amp;dn":"A+Quiet+Life+2010+BDRip+XviD-AEN","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"93c733b53b2c387579847fd9e76c3273a2b6062f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,199,51,181,59,44,56,117,121,132,127,217,231,108,50,115,162,182,6,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
