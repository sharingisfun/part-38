Released in 1979, Sky Yen was a collection of electronic music that didn&amp;#039;t sound much like his full-time band&amp;#039;s blistering guitar pop, yet it did contain the roots of his solo career. After the Buzzcocks disbanded in 1981, Shelley began a solo career which incorporated the electronic experimentations of Sky Yen with the pop sensibilities of his punk singles. Released in 1981, Homosapien showcased this musical merger and resulted in the U.K. hit single, &quot;Homosapien.&quot; The following year Shelley released XL1, which added more guitar to his dance-oriented synth pop. Three years later he released his final solo album, Heaven and the Sea, which failed to capture an audience. Shelley then joined the short-lived band Zip; after its breakup, he rejoined the reunited Buzzcocks in 1988. \n\nWith XL1, Pete Shelley integrates layers of guitar into the electronic synth-pop he essayed on his solo debut, Homosapien. While the result isn&amp;#039;t quite as bracing as its predecessor, the music benefits from the guitar ? it sounds edgier, making the record fairly captivating. There&amp;#039;s still some weak material on the record, but &quot;Telephone Operator&quot; and &quot;If You Ask Me (I Won&amp;#039;t Say No)&quot; are terrific, ranking among Shelley&amp;#039;s best. \n \n\nTracks:\n\n01   Telephone Operator     3:14  \n02   If You Ask Me (I Won&amp;#039;t Say No)    4:20 \n03   What Was Heaven?   5:40  \n04   You Know Better Than I Know    5:04  \n05   Twilight   3:08  \n06   (Millions of People) No One Like You     4:07  \n07   Many a Time     6:41  \n08   I Just Wanna Touch   3:04  \n09   You and I   3:00  \n10   XL1    3:27  \n11   Telephone Operator/Many a Time [*/dub]      \n12   If You Ask Me/No One Like You [*/dub]  \n\n   \n    \n    \n    \n   \n \n       \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f9cb0854ac6ecc03022fdb20c73248a1cc8b20e","amp;dn":"Pete+Shelley+-+XL+1+%5B1983%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f9cb0854ac6ecc03022fdb20c73248a1cc8b20e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,156,176,133,74,198,236,192,48,34,253,178,12,115,36,138,28,200,178,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
