They still exist doing great shows but I'm bored with it. Check out this release tho, it's on Zvuk MoÃ„ï¿½vare, short lived label that got killed by Croatian version of RIAA. I suppose they didn't like the band making their own cd with a help of some friends.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c6394cc8e3df710e9a78b38f85ef8b9ee089df68","amp;dn":"FAKOFBOLAN+%5B2002%5D+Provincija+uzvra%C4%87a+udarac+%7BFLAC%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c6394cc8e3df710e9a78b38f85ef8b9ee089df68","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,57,76,200,227,223,113,14,154,120,179,143,133,239,139,158,224,137,223,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
