But Wonder Where IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m Bound, a US-only LP comprised mostly of outtakes released to cash in with 1968 hit, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Abraham, Martin &amp; JohnÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, is long due reappraisal, too. This was largely recorded in 1964/5, and buried among the expected doo-wop material were some good surprises, including the fiery garage blues of Willie DixonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Seventh SonÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, and a haunting take on the title track, written by Tom Paxton, which featured a pre-Highway 61 Al Kooper on keys. DionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s version of Ã¢â‚¬Å“ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s All Over Now, Baby BlueÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is astonishing Ã¢â‚¬â€œ West Coast folk-rock with added NY grime, it manages to recall The Velvet Underground at their most melodic. But Dion got there first!\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba261465fa12d9ae6f0e583c2a5025ec8ad8b3d3","amp;dn":"Dion+-+Wonder+Where+I%27m+Bound+%5B1969%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba261465fa12d9ae6f0e583c2a5025ec8ad8b3d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,38,20,101,250,18,217,174,111,14,88,60,42,80,37,236,138,216,179,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
