In Bios boot mode, the\nrecovery partitions work fine for all indexes, and win8.x/server2012 does\nnot have the UEFI recovery image problem.\n-In fact, the recovery partition option is one of the major benefits of\nusing scripting methods for applying images. With applying and capturing\nto a recovery partition, you can even re-mount the recovery image and\nshrink to an install.esd file if you know your way around reagentc and\ndism. I have not provided scripts for that because it's not a good idea\nto play with those things if you don't know your way around diskpart.\n-Bios boot setup uses x86, so if you need to add a driver, get the x86\nversion for winpe 5.1. UEFI boot defaults to x64 options only. The script\nwill not stop you if you decide to install an x86 index on a UEFI boot\nsystem, but it will warn you against it.\n-I've tucked win7 x86 and x64 drivers in a folder on the iso. You'll need\nthese for win7 or server2008r2 if you need any storage, usb, or network\ndrivers. Remember to point the script at the proper folder (x86 or x64)\n\nChanges:\n-Added win7 and server 2008 r2 non-sp1 versions\n-Added (with Update) versions of Win8.1 and 2012 R2\n-Changed methods so that only the Name of the index is changed. The\ndescription remains unchanged for those hard to identify how to activate\nserver versions.\n-Changed install.esd method for split-wim for UEFI support\n-DaRT7 boot option has usb3, network, storage, drivers integrated\n-Got all the UEFI features working and tested.\n\nCredits: MicroSoft, murphy78, and a minor credit to generalmx for the winpe\nsubfolder parse for winpe.\n\nThx to: a few friends who helped me with a few isos. You know who you are,\nand you rule :)\n\nEnjoy the V4 Epicness,\nmurphy78-TPB/MDL :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9299817235f77369014fa814479e3a95353b79b5","amp;dn":"Windows+SuperAIO+v4+181-in-1+en-US+DaRT7-8.1+-+murphy78","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9299817235f77369014fa814479e3a95353b79b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,153,129,114,53,247,115,105,1,79,168,20,71,158,58,149,53,59,121,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
