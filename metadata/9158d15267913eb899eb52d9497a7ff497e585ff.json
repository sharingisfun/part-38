Wakusei Daisenso - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076902/\n\nClassic Japanese sci-fi flick from Toho Ltd. made in 1977, directed by Jun Fukuda. Hard to find!\nAlso known as: Battle in Outer Space 2, Uchu Daisenso 2, Planet Wars, etc.\n\nThere also was a German release by UFA called &quot;Der grosse Krieg der Planeten&quot; with German audio, which was even released as a 45-minute cutdown version on super-8 film. Not video...real film. :-)\n(I wish I could find that German audio...anyone?)\n\nTechnical stuff:\n\nThis is a proper DVD rip in XviD/MP3 .avi format with (rather nice) English audio. Sorry, no Japanese audio or subtitles included...\n\nResolution: 720x304\nFrame rate: 23.976 fps\nSound: MP3 stereo, 48000 Hz, 128 kbit/sec\n\nEnjoy!!! And seed, dammit ;-)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9158d15267913eb899eb52d9497a7ff497e585ff","amp;dn":"The+War+in+Space+%28Wakusei+Daisenso%29+Toho+1977+%28English+Dub%29.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9158d15267913eb899eb52d9497a7ff497e585ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,88,209,82,103,145,62,184,153,235,82,217,73,122,127,244,151,229,133,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
