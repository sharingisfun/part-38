Set on a planet where the sun shines for just a few minutes once every nine years, this is a classic tale of suffering and forgiveness.

Winner of a CINE Golden Eagle, and honored by Instructor Magazine as one of the 25 Best Films of the Year.\nProduced by LCA.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e03235825864f4929f0ef346df2510feff88ec77","amp;dn":"All+Summer+in+a+Day+-+Ray+Bradbury+-+1982+-+VHSRIP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e03235825864f4929f0ef346df2510feff88ec77","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,50,53,130,88,100,244,146,159,14,243,70,223,37,16,254,255,136,236,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
