It contains information for the experienced C programmer that I have never found elsewhere on how C code works 'behind the scenes' (assembly language, binary arithmetic, complex pointer math, stack frames, function call jump tables, etc.). It is not a book for beginning programmers, and it is not in any way an introduction to the C language, it is however, an unusual resource for the experienced programmer.\n\nrr","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ee278a0856eff20929c6811432d0f36d199253c","amp;dn":"C+Companion+-+Allen+I.+Holub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ee278a0856eff20929c6811432d0f36d199253c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,226,120,160,133,110,255,32,146,156,104,17,67,45,15,54,209,153,37,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
