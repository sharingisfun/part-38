The music itself was a fairly unique blend of up-tempo, high energy, pop/disco numbers, well-chosen covers and classy ballads, giving them a breadth of material never matched by the likes of Westlife and Boyzone. \n\nAll sixteen of their UK singles, including &amp;#039;Back For Good&amp;#039;, &amp;#039;Pray&amp;#039;, &amp;#039;Relight My Fire&amp;#039;, &amp;#039;A Million Love Songs&amp;#039;, &amp;#039;Never Forget&amp;#039;, &amp;#039;It Only Takes A Minute&amp;#039; and &amp;#039;Could It Be Magic&amp;#039; are featured here, alongside a bonus live track, a 2005 remix of &amp;#039;Relight My Fire&amp;#039; and a newly recorded track, &amp;#039;Today I Lost You&amp;#039;, which was written as the follow up to &amp;#039;Back For Good&amp;#039; in 1995, but never recorded until this year.\n\n               hope you enjoy\n\n\n                    Alan","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:61e3b59a89f787bb8d99db9257025c7d56be2582","amp;dn":"Take+That+-+Never+Forget+%5B2005%5D%5BCD%2B3Vids%2BCovers%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"61e3b59a89f787bb8d99db9257025c7d56be2582","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,227,181,154,137,247,135,187,141,153,219,146,87,2,92,125,86,190,37,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
