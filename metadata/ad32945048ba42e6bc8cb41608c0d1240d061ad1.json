Originally credited as Vesta Williams, she was sometimes simply billed as Vesta beginning in the 1990s. She was known for her four-octave vocal range. She once sang The Star Spangled Banner for the Los Angeles Lakers game opener using all four of those octaves. Although Williams never had any albums certified gold nor any Top 40 hits on the Billboard Hot 100, she scored six Top 10 hits on the United States Billboard R&amp;B chart from the mid-1980s to the early 1990s. Williams was known for the hits &quot;Once Bitten, Twice Shy&quot;, &quot;Sweet Sweet Love&quot;, &quot;Special&quot;, and her 1989 hit and signature song, &quot;Congratulations&quot;.\n\nI was a bit shocked to learn that VESTA never had any records turn GOLD. I thought her CONGRATULATIONS song was a phenomenal hit, used at many formal events. Nonetheless VESTA had much love from her loyal fans and this album SEVEN was her last album before her untimely death. I was finally able to secure the album, which was harder to find that hen's teeth, but here it is.\n\nEnjoy the upload and remember to SEED SEED SEED as much as you can so that the music lives forever.\n\n\nVESTA - SEVEN Album Includes\n\nVesta - Water On The World\nVesta - Better Days\nVesta - Silly\nVesta - What Is This\nVesta - Hold On\nVesta - Five Ways\nVesta - All You Girls\nVesta - Dedicated \nVesta - Can We Talk About It\nVesta - Truth Of The Matter\nVesta - Rewind\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad32945048ba42e6bc8cb41608c0d1240d061ad1","amp;dn":"Vesta+Williams+-+SEVEN+2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ad32945048ba42e6bc8cb41608c0d1240d061ad1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,50,148,80,72,186,66,230,188,140,180,22,8,192,209,36,13,6,26,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
