Her allegations of misconduct within the FBI following the attacks of September 11, 2001, came to the attention of the Senate Judiciary Committee and led to a call for an independent audit of the FBI's translation unit. She subsequently gave sworn testimony accusing current and former members of the government of treasonous activity. Edmonds is the subject of a documentary, Kill the Messenger, and she hosts a website, Boiling Frogs. The FBI has attempted to prevent the publication of her book, Classified Woman: The Sibel Edmonds Story. \n\nAlex also covers the Obama impeachment bill, calls for a more invasive and &quot;tougher&quot; TSA, and the continued government crackdown on raw milk.\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n \n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential \n to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a\n spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the &quot;big \n picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media \n for news and info is a prescription for ignorance.
