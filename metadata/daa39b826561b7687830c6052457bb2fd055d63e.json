The group is led by Rick Grimes, who was a sheriff's deputy in King County, Georgia, before the zombie outbreak. As their situation grows more and more grim, the group's desperation to survive pushes them to the very edge of sanity. At every turn they are faced with unspeakable horrors, both from the undead and the scattered remains of a struggling human populace.\n\n(from the facebook-page of &quot;the walking dead&quot;)\n\nAlso see: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1520211/\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:daa39b826561b7687830c6052457bb2fd055d63e","amp;dn":"The+Walking+Dead+S01+%282010%29+TVrip+%28hardcoded+NL+subs%29+-+hajo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"daa39b826561b7687830c6052457bb2fd055d63e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,163,155,130,101,97,183,104,120,48,198,5,36,87,187,47,208,85,214,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
