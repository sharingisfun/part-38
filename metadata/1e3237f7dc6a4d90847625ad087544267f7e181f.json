The game named after him is a whole lot like God of War, but this brash action hero is no Kratos. He is, in fact, a walking and talking cliche, shouting out &quot;Feel the burn&quot; when he summons fire from the heavens, and &quot;Trust meÃ¢â‚¬Â¦it's going to be a bloodbath&quot; as he wades into danger. Marlow Briggs--the game, not its star--is keenly aware of its unoriginality, poking fun at video game tropes and its own hackneyed tribalism. Sometimes, self-aware humor is a crutch used to excuse banal gameplay, but Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death earns the right to make fun of itself: it's a fast-paced confection that's quite good on its own terms. The silly attitude is just sugar on top.\n\n\n\n* enjoy ...
