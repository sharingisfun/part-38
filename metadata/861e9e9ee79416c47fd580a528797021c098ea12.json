Filmed in Australia, Mauritius, south Africa, Oahu and Kauai. The music was all written &amp; performed by a psychedelic rock acid folk outfit called TULLY featuring Richard Lockwood and Michael Carlos.\n----\n\n&quot;To come to an adequate understanding of the relationship between Tully and the Australian surfing scene of the late sixties, early seventies, it is important to know that while the members of that enigmatic group lived in the northern beach-side suburbs of Sydney where many famous and talented surfers and surf film makers also lived, they were not surfers themselves. Being lovers of beauty, however, they were irresistibly attracted to the vast expanses of the sea and sky, the natural world. This was their affinity with the surfing fraternity.\n\nWhen film maker Paul Witzig asked Tully to compose the music for Sea of Joy he was seeking a soundtrack to suit the mood of a generation, for whom peace and freedom were the guiding lights. It was an obvious choice: in the vanguard of the Sydney underground Tully had already carved a deep and impressive curve into the pipeline of musical innovation, a wave it would ultimately ride to the shore. The music the group produced for Sea of Joy is testimony to the accolades it received at the time, and makes the film uniquely different to anything that precedes it.\n\nThe premiere of Sea of Joy was a hands-on affair for Tully: they sold the tickets, collected them at the door, projected the film and manned the ice-cream stand. Col Campbell's following anecdote describes it well: 'When Sea of Joy premiered at the Mandala Theatre, Sydney, few of the queuing throng knew that the strange characters trying to sell them chocolate-coated bananas were the film's soundtrack musicians. Surf on, crazy diamonds.&quot;\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:861e9e9ee79416c47fd580a528797021c098ea12","amp;dn":"Tully...Sea+Of+Joy%281972%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"861e9e9ee79416c47fd580a528797021c098ea12","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,30,158,158,231,148,22,196,127,213,128,165,40,121,112,33,192,152,234,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
