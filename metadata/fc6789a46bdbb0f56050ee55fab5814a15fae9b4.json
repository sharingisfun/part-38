They have released eight LPs and eight EPs since 1998.\n\nPond has been the only consistent member, although Chris Hansen is now considered to be a core member of the group.\n\nIn the studio, they often collaborate with other musicians including former members to achieve their diverse instrumentation and expansive sound. In recent years, Pond and Hansen have produced the recordings from a cabin in Bearsville, NY.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Pond_PA&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Pond_PA&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2000 - Measure\n\nTracklist:\n\n01.
