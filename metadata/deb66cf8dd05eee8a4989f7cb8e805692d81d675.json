However there is a bit of history all over this album.It starts of with John Barry Seven Plus Four and indeed this is John Barry in his early days before he really hit the big time with all the movie scores. Tchaikosky's ballet's &quot;Swan Lake&quot; gets a rocking treatment by four guys from Bristol called The Cougars. We have Brian Bennett who is the drummer of The Shadows in a band called The Krew Kats where he was in before The Shadows, and a further track with Brian Bennett in another band being Thunder Company. We have The Fentones who were the backing band for Shane Fenton who later scored hits under the name of Alvin Stardust, whereas Bobby Elliot, the drummer of The Fentones became the drummer with The Hollies. Apart from Flying by The Beatles is another little diddy that McCartney wrote called &quot;Love In The Open Air&quot; for a movie called &quot;The Family Way&quot; and the song was released by Sounds Sensational. The Roulettes were the backing band of Adam Faith and Sounds Incorporated were once called the &quot;Best Backing Band&quot; by Little Richard and they deliver a nice version of &quot;Spanish Harlem. And there's Sounds Nice who had a minor hit with &quot;Love At First Sight&quot; which in reality is an instrumental version of Je T'ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡ime Moi Non Plus by Serge Gainsbourgh and Jane Birkin which at the time was banned by the BBC for it's explicit heavy breathing and groaning on the song. Another backing band were The Dakotas who backed Billy J. Kramer. So a lot of history indeed in these tunes.\n\nTracklist:\n01. Hit And Miss - John Barry Seven Plus Four - 1960\n02.
