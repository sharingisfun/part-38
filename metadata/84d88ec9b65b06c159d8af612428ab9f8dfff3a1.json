Overall the standard is very good, as some outfits (such as the Easy\nLivin&amp;#039; Band) get extremely close to the trademark Uriah Heep sound - often\nwith near exact emulation. Bronz produce a solid heavy version or two,\nalthough like several other acts, they suffer from the extensive use of\nprogramming. Still, Denny Ball&amp;#039;s Firefly is atmospheric and , with old boys\nKen Hensley and John Lawton taking part, this set is well put together, if\nover produced. Great fun albeit for total fanatics only.\n\nCD1\n\n1.  Bird of Prey - Easy Linin, Band\n2.  The Wizard - Clive Rodgers and Cobra\n3.  Stealin, - Native Son\n4.
