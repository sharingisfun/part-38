I came across Taj&amp;#039;s &quot;Very Best Of&quot; disc and listened to a few samples from it in the record store, and it sounded great... So I bought it. Taj Mahal definitely has his own unique flavor, excellent tunes (whether composed or re-interpreted), and excellent singing voice that is strong and assertive and at the same time very melodic and gentle. His blues range from jazzy to rocky to down-home. Some very classy tunes. When I first bought this disc, it was the only disc I played in my car probably for several weeks until I got thoroughly familiar with it. This disc seems like a very good intro to Taj Mahal&amp;#039;s work because it covers a variety of styles and gives you an idea about what this artist can do. He&amp;#039;s an underemphasized gem musically, and I hear he&amp;#039;s a real class act. I will be buying more of his CDs in the near future for absolutely certain.&quot; \n\n&quot;Everything about this album is very high quality. Pleasing song choices, a top rate artist, phenomenal sound quality, and the twenty tracks. However, I must rate it at 4 stars because it claims to be &quot;The Very Best of Taj Mahal&quot;. This is, better stated, the very best of Taj Mahal throughout the 1990s. Everyone who appreciates fine blues music will easily appreciate this fine sampling of his later works. Despite this not being a sampling of all his works throughout his musical career, this album is a fine selection to own. Many of these tracks highlight Mahal the eclectic, a genius who in later years combined strong elements of jazz, Zydeco, Calypso, reggae and tribal music fusion with his blues. Take the first track, &quot;Senor Blues&quot;. This song begins with a bossa nova kind of feeling, with Mahal singing the song with a Latin inflection. Track two, &quot;Don&amp;#039;t Call Us&quot;, has almost a pop feeling to it, with elements of gospel music somewhere within. Tracks three and four have a much more down-home blues feeling to them. Track five, Betty and Dupree, has strong country blues qualities. The mixture is unique throughout on this album, showing a side of Taj Mahal fans who had not steadfastly followed him throughout his career might not easily recognize. Often I have played these tracks for friends who do not believe me when I tell them it is Taj Mahal. Excellent album for your collection!&quot; \n\nBrought to you by TQMP.
