Designed by a team of skilled engineers and boasting some of the most advanced technologies and safety features of the time, she was hailed as Ã¢â‚¬Å“unsinkableÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Then, just four days into her maiden voyage, she struck an iceberg and sank, instantly becoming the most infamous maritime disaster in history. Of the 2,223 passengers on board, 1,517 died at sea.\n\nNow, 100 years on from that tragic day, the legend of Titanic lives on and the story of the ship continues to fascinate. To commemorate the 100th anniversary of the disaster, HISTORYÃ¢â€žÂ¢ has brought together six programmes that examine what went wrong on that fateful day. We will cover the building of the Titanic and the technology of the ship before delving beneath the surface to piece together its final moments, creating an intimate portrait of the vessel nobody believed could sink.\n\n\n\n\nRelease date   04/04/2012\nRegions        Region 4 PAL\nGenres         Documentary\nruntime        2:14 hours","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:498906558f3c670169c6dc414892b7ed91a2459f","amp;dn":"Titanic+100+Years+Below+%282012%29+PAL+DVDrip+mkv+-+mr.kairo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"498906558f3c670169c6dc414892b7ed91a2459f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,137,6,85,143,60,103,1,105,198,220,65,72,146,183,237,145,162,69,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
