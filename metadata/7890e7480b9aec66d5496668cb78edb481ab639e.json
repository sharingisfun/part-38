The album is the follow up to Parade, and Prince's first &quot;solo&quot; album following his departure from The Revolution; the symbol between the quotes is a peace sign. The double album was a synthesis of three projects from 1986, including some work with The Revolution. The bulk of the tracks originate from the final Revolution project known as Dream Factory and a later solo project called Camille. These projects, along with some other songs merged into a 22-track, 3-LP opus called Crystal Ball. Prince's record company, Warner Bros. Records, balked at the idea of a 3-LP album, considering the lukewarm performance of Parade, and Prince's second movie, Under the Cherry Moon, and forced Prince to trim the album down. The result was Sign o' the Times, which quickly became widely regarded as Prince's magnum opus amongst fans and critics alike. The album yielded three top-ten hits, the most from a Prince album since 1984's Purple Rain.\nfrom wikipedia\n\n\n\nExact Audio Copy V0.99 prebeta 3 from 28.
