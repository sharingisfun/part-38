Next Life \n\nAs we went through the first decade of the new century, rock and metal received an infusion of the classic 70Ã¢â‚¬Â²s sound. Now that we have entered our second decade, a renewed wave of 80Ã¢â‚¬Â²s arena rock blending in with todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hard rock and metal sound. More testosterone and less AquaNet, but all the great feel good, crank it up to 11 and lose your mind rock and roll.\n\nWeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been waiting a long time for this release, but the band now has a new home at eOne Music who released the record on July 5th-the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ultimate independence day. And trust me, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been worth the wait. 'War of Angels' is a serious dose of Viagra for the ears. If this record doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t make you rock, hard, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re likely dead or deaf.\n\nProducer Johnny K (Airbourne, Disturbed, Sevendust, Machine Head) has helped elevate the band and this album to the next level on War Of Angels, and you can hear his intensity as well as the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s passion for making this project an epic release that can endure for years.\n\nThe record kicks off with the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first single, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Last Man StandingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ which is a hard driving, in your face, headbanger loaded with crunchy guitars and a right cross to the chin. Most albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s these days seem to front load one or two solid tracks at the beginning and the album gets progressively weaker from there on out, but believe me when I say, this opening volley is just the foundation for whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s to come.\n\nBefore you can even catch your breath, the band cranks it up another notch, carving an Ã¢â‚¬Å“EpitaphÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in your chest. This song is an angry, chew you up and spit you out, horns-up anthem, with lots of thick guitar rhythms.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Broken and BetrayedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is an angst driven number, which kicks off with a sweet rolling guitar riff, that takes us down a moody melodic path to the infectious chorus.\n\nBy this point youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re about ready to slow it down, and the band obliges with a beautiful aching piece, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Monster You MadeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, which could be as much about the the lover who has broken you down, or a face to face look at the monster in the mirror.\nFor fans of classic 80Ã¢â‚¬Â²s arena-lighter songs in the power ballad mold, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Let It GoÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ should fill the ache nicely.\n\nThen the band revs it up again, with the chugging rocker, Ã¢â‚¬Å“BossÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ DaughterÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. This track is pure ear candy addiction, and a monster live on stage.\n\nNext up is Ã¢â‚¬Å“Daisy ChainÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, which kicks off with an opening riff and chorus that brings to mind, The Cult.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“PurpleÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is another dynamic, almost poetic gem of a lost-love song. Ã¢â‚¬Å“It only hurts when IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m soberÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nThe crunchy grinding guitars return in an edgy gallop for Ã¢â‚¬Å“Black &amp; BlueÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n\nThe album wraps up with the beautiful, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Next LifeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. While it wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be on the regular version of the album, the band also recorded the catchy arena anthem, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Save the WorldÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, which fans can still get for free (as of this writing) if they simply LIKE the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢spage.\n\nThe albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bonus track (from the Deluxe Edition), Ã¢â‚¬Å“Good With the BadÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, recalls Southern rock, with a Lynyrd Skynyrd meets The Black Crowes vibe.\n\n'War of Angels' has no filler tracks, and sets the stage for Pop Evil to ascend a few rungs up the rock hierarchy. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s strong from top to bottom, and youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be hard pressed to pry it from your CD player or iPod once you get your ears on it. 'War of Angels' brings us the battle of good versus Pop Evil.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5766d2b08d514c0016dcb93ae91f955dc5c089d3","amp;dn":"Pop+Evil+-+War+of+Angels+%5B2011%5D+%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5766d2b08d514c0016dcb93ae91f955dc5c089d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,102,210,176,141,81,76,0,22,220,185,58,233,31,149,93,197,192,137,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
