Although Weller had clearly matured and become concerned about and influenced by different things it was still a massive change in both approach and image. The cod-politics and fake homoeroticism (together with the white jeans) of much of The Style Council's output and image had also been flushed down the pan in no uncertain manner. Eschewing virtually everything from his past (which had included singles going straight in at number one) Weller had completely reinvented himself, not for any &quot;career choices&quot; but simply because he wanted to.\nHis musical influences are very clear on this album - late 1960s Traffic, a bit of latter-day Small Faces, Humble Pie, Nick Drake, Neil Young and even singer-songwriters like Gordon Lightfoot. One would have thought this was a recipe for complete commercial suicide. Weller's first solo album, two years earlier was excellent, but didn't really sell well. However, &quot;Wild Wood&quot;, for some reason, caught on with the loved up crowd and the festival generation and Weller was suddenly embraced by a younger crowd as &quot;The Modfather&quot; and granted both respect and kudos from people not old enough to properly remember the early days of The Jam.\nThe music itself is perfect for a hot summer morning (why I reckon it might even be good &quot;chill-out&quot; fare, whatever that may be!). It is a very pastoral, laid back album, perfectly exemplified on the title track and others like &quot;The Foot Of The Mountain&quot;, &quot;5th Season&quot; and &quot;The Weaver&quot;. There is lots of choppy guitar, swirling organ, matching acoustic guitar and solid drums. It is both rock and folky wistfulness rolled into one. I cannot say much more than this album is sublimely atmospheric and a delight from beginning to end. It is now fourteen years old and sounds just as fresh today as back in 1993. Highly recommended.\n\nEnjoy.\n\n\n\n\nPrince say's if you take it and like it please say thank you\n\n\n\nIf For Any Reeson You Don't Like it delete it I am sick and tired of people Getting stuff for free then finding or try to find fault with it., If this is Not good enough for you Then Go Out And Buy The Original, As i had to. This One Is Free.
