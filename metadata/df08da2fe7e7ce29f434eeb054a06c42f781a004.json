Training for retail consumer manufacturers. Geared towards Tech Support for the consumer. This is great info on the newest in the line of OS&amp;#039;s from M$. Everything form HOW-TO&amp;#039;S to HOW-NOT-TO&amp;#039;s. Designed to push out to manufacturer Tech Support, for the beginner to the higher level user. What can I say everthing M$ won&amp;#039;t support but let the retailers do. I can&amp;#039;t say enough about this material for what is out there now. Haven&amp;#039;t seen any instruction manuals better than this. Everything the new Vista can and cant do. Step by step guides on how to break it and to fix it. Good stuff.\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df08da2fe7e7ce29f434eeb054a06c42f781a004","amp;dn":"Vista+Training+%28Working%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df08da2fe7e7ce29f434eeb054a06c42f781a004","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,8,218,47,231,231,206,41,244,52,238,176,84,160,108,66,247,129,160,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
