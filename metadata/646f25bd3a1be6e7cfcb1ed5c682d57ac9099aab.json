The Parting Glass\t1:45\n\nJesse Ferguson's second album, The Parting Glass gathers Irish, Scottish, Canadian and American folk songs that recount the various partings people have and still must endure, from leaving oneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s country to losing a loved one. JesseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s own song, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Sun Set on My Love,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ attempts to honour and extend this tradition. \nOn this CD Jesse performed all vocals, including harmonies, and instrumentals, including guitar, mandolin, fiddle, bodhran, djembe, tambourine, fife, penny whistle, harmonica, JewÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s harp and rhythm bones. He also recorded, mixed and mastered the songs on Mixcraft 5, and he designed the covers of the album. The album was a labour of love, and it covers a broad spectrum from slow ballads to rollicking sea shanties and drinking songs.\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:646f25bd3a1be6e7cfcb1ed5c682d57ac9099aab","amp;dn":"Jesse+Ferguson...The+Parting+Glass%282011%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"646f25bd3a1be6e7cfcb1ed5c682d57ac9099aab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,111,37,189,58,27,230,231,207,203,30,213,198,130,213,122,201,9,154,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
