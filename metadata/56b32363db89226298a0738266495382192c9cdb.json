In a clear, concise and sometimes bitterly funny lecture, NOAM CHOMSKY shows us who is getting the money, who is producing and exporting the drugs, and what the war on the ground is really about. In the ongoing debate over whether Columbia will become the 'next Vietnam,' CHOMSKY'S analysis will provide a great introduction to the Columbian elite, the role of the US media, how 'development' works. Imagine Traffic starring CHOMSKY instead of Michael Douglas.\n\nNoam Chomsky is an influential linguist, professor, author, and activist. Chomsky has been active in left-wing politics and he opposed the Vietnam War. He is the eighth most cited source of all time, and is considered the ''most cited living author''. Chomsky is also the author of over 150 books.\n\n\nRunning Time: 52:11\n\n\n1  Where The Arms Are\n2  Military Aid To Turkey\n3  Terrorism\n4  Colombia\n5  Inequality In Latin America\n6  Impact Of US Intervention\n7  Pacification\n8  The Drug War\n9  The Deeper Reasons\n10 The New Imperialism\n11 Globalization\n12 Rational Peasants\n13 What Right Does The US HAve To Intervene?\n14 The Role Of US Banks\n15 It's Well Known How To Deal With The Drug Problems\n16 The Real Objectives\n17 Paramilitaries And Narcotrafficking\n18 As Long As Injustice Remains\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/images/1902593448/ref=dp_image_0?ie=UTF8&amp;n=283155&amp;s=books&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/images/1902593448/ref=dp_image_0?ie=UTF8&amp;n=283155&amp;s=books&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56b32363db89226298a0738266495382192c9cdb","amp;dn":"Noam+Chomsky+-+An+American+Addiction+Drugs%2C+Guerillas%2C+and+Count","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56b32363db89226298a0738266495382192c9cdb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,179,35,99,219,137,34,98,152,160,115,130,102,73,83,130,25,44,156,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
