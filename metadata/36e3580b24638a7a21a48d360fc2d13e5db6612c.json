But when a man is murdered in the alley behind her place, she's dismayed when his spirit appears, too, asking for help.\n\nFBI agent Dallas Samson has a passionate interest in the murder, since the victim's a colleague whose death is connected to the smuggling ring known as Los Lobos--the wolves. Now Dallas is even more committed to chasing them down....\n\nUnaware that Dallas has certain abilities of his own, Hannah calls her cousin Kelsey O'Brien, a member of the FBI's Krewe of Hunters, an elite unit of paranormal investigators. The present-day case is linked to a historical mystery involving salvagers, a curse and a sunken ship. Danger and desire bring Hannah and Dallas together, but to survive, they have to solve the mysteries of the past--and stay alive...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36e3580b24638a7a21a48d360fc2d13e5db6612c","amp;dn":"Heather+Graham+-+The+Cursed+%28Retail%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36e3580b24638a7a21a48d360fc2d13e5db6612c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,227,88,11,36,99,138,122,33,164,141,54,15,194,209,62,93,182,97,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
