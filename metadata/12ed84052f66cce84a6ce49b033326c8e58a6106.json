The first batch of 128 locomotive were built with head code discs and painted in BR green with a grey roof; the second batch of 100 locomotives were fitted with head code boxes. \n\nKnown by their nickname Ã¢â‚¬ËœChoppersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, a name derived from the distinctive beat that the engine produced under load and resembling the sound of a helicopter, the Class 20Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s relatively low power output Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 1,000 horsepower Ã¢â‚¬â€œ saw many operate in pairs across the British rail network. This was also due to the poor visibility caused by their long nose, which saw the locomotives run almost exclusively cab first. \n\nAs freight operations on the network decreased, the Class 20 started to become obsolete and disappeared from regular appearances on the mainline. However, many locomotives were transferred to private operators, including Direct Rail Services and for use on the construction of the Channel Tunnel and High Speed 1. \n\nA total of 26 models have also been preserved, including the first of the Class built Ã¢â‚¬â€œ D8000 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ which is part of the National Railway Collection at the National Railway Museum in York, UK. \n\nThe Class 20 for Train Simulator is a former Iron Horse House model, which has been updated to TS2014 standard, including new scenarios and improved exterior modelling. It is available in light weathered British Railways Green livery, representing a model from the first batch of Class 20s built and featuring changeable front and read head code discs. Other detailing includes slow speed control for Ã¢â‚¬Ëœmerry-go-roundÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ trains, cab and instrument lighting, and 16-ton mineral wagons.\n\nThe locomotive is also Quick Drive compatible, giving you the freedom to drive the BR Class 20 on any Quick Drive enabled route for Train Simulator, such as those available through Steam. Also included are scenarios specifically for the Western Lines of Scotland route (available separately and required to play these scenarios).\n\n\nScenarios\n\nFour scenarios for the Western Lines of Scotland route:\n\nSimple Controls Tutorial: Class 20 \n\nExpert Controls Tutorial: Class 20 \n\nStranraer Struggle \n\nTanker Train\n\n\neNJOY AND SEEED PEOPLE!!!!!!!!!!!!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:12ed84052f66cce84a6ce49b033326c8e58a6106","amp;dn":"Railworks+TS2014+BR+Class+20+Loco+Add-On","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"12ed84052f66cce84a6ce49b033326c8e58a6106","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,237,132,5,47,102,204,232,74,108,228,155,3,51,38,200,229,138,97,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
