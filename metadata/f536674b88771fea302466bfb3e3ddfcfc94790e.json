Based on a short story by Ian Rankin, Reichenbach Falls combines suspense, humour, twisty puzzles, and lots of references to live and fictional mystery writers and characters. Even his name was borrowed from John Buchan, who as author of The Thirty-Nine Steps and its sequels is considered by many to be the creator of the modern spy thriller. And the name of DI Buchan's 'best friend', author Jack Harvey, is a pseudonym used by Rankin himself. The theme music of the film is Gerry Rafferty's Baker Street. A very smart film whose smartness doesn't get in the way of it being good.
