The solitude of her woodsy family estate, the peace of her tranquil town, and the unspoken somberness of her home life are suddenly upended by not only this mysterious accident, but by the sudden arrival of her Uncle Charlie (Matthew Goode), whom she never knew existed. When Charlie moves in with her and her emotionally unstable mother Evie (Nicole Kidman), India thinks the void left by her father's death is finally being filled by his closest bloodline. Soon after his arrival, India comes to suspect that this mysterious, charming man has ulterior motives. Yet instead of feeling outrage or horror, this friendless young woman becomes increasingly infatuated with him. \n\n\n\nContainer: MKV File   (remember R5)\n\nSubs: Realuploads2 \n\nTestet: WinRaR Extract to\n\n\nRemember to seed so others can get the same enjoyment of the movie that you've got.\nKeep in mind I can not give full speed to all, so if you're one of the lucky ones, help seed.\n\nAnd remember, because I upload in winRAR files, it does not mean that it is &quot;VIRUS&quot;.\n\nPress my name &quot;Realuploads&quot; and see my other uploads before you write crap.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you use RssReader then copy this to &quot;My feeds&quot;: \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://rss.thepiratebay.se/user/acb357ddd9a0e1461108ab0ca9c1f5cb&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://rss.thepiratebay.se/user/acb357ddd9a0e1461108ab0ca9c1f5cb&lt;/a&gt; \n(copy the link)\n\nand you will see my uploads when it comes on the page.\n\nOr\n\nIf you want to download immediately when they are uploaded, go into uTorrent and add feeds and make settings to download.\n\n \n\nGroup Realuploads  ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81c66dccf23b68ab012ebf23cbf232f89205664e","amp;dn":"Stoker+%28+Dk+subs+%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81c66dccf23b68ab012ebf23cbf232f89205664e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,198,109,204,242,59,104,171,1,46,191,35,203,242,50,248,146,5,102,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
