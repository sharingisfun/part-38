This is for the people in the world who like great rock not for the 10 million who listen to Beiber.\n\n- Big Papi\n\nimage\n\nimage\n\nBy Bill\nThis is one of the greatest, if not the greatest &quot;surf punk&quot; rock bands ever to come out of California, and their longevity is a testament to their ability to rock (I believe they were a local Orange County band for years before releasing a full length album). Although this album isn't as polished as many of the contemporary punk rock albums, you can't mistake the musicianship and unique creativity incorporated into their catchy &quot;surf style&quot; riffs. The songs are energetic, easy to sing along to, and provide enough party gusto to get any punk rock pit moving (in a fun-loving way, not in an aggravated &quot;I'm more punk than you are&quot; way). Many songs on this album like &quot;Head Start&quot; are rich with humor. There's something about this album that makes you want to cruise the beach with friends or down cocktails at a BBQ. If you like surfing, beer, girls, partying, punk rock, or all of the above, this band is for you. Their live show is a blast as well (K.C. Maddox, the lead singer, is known for throwing free cigars out to the crowd)!\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nWhite Kaps - Blown in the U.S.A.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: White Kaps\nAlbum................: Blown in the U.S.A.\nGenre................: Surf Punk\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1994\n\nFLAC\n\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.2.1 20070917\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 69 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\n\nMP3 V0 (Highest Quality Available For MP3)\n\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: LAME 3.99\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Extreme, (avg. bitrate: 264kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.
