There has to be something rooted deep within her to make her feed off of the pain she inflicts on other people. Perhaps it is her own pain that she has suppressed for so many years. It's an unimaginable pain that creates an internal prison in which her mind is the only captive. Whatever the cause, once the demons within her break free, those around her better beware. Helen feels no shame about the fact that she hasn't been saved. Will the divas of New Day Temple of Faith think Helen is worth saving? More importantly, can God save Helen from not only her evil past, but from herself?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:088f4bad7dbcc0544e6d917367cc1abdf6f4b271","amp;dn":"E.N.+joy-I+Aint+Me+No+More","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"088f4bad7dbcc0544e6d917367cc1abdf6f4b271","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,143,75,173,125,188,192,84,78,109,145,115,103,204,26,189,246,244,178,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
