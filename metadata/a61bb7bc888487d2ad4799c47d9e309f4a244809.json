Would you spend the night in a \nhaunted house? When twisted billionaire Stephen Price and his devilish wife, \nEvelyn, offer six strangers one million dollars each, there is only one \nrule to the game: they'll have to survive one night in a former mental \ninstitution, haunted by the ghosts of the inmates killed there, and an \ninsane doctor who did unspeakable things... At first, everyone is having \nfun, thinking that the whole thing is a joke. But once the entire house \nautomatically seals itself shut, they realize that this is no joke.\n\nStars.\n=&gt;-Geoffrey Rush.\n=&gt;-Famke Janssen.\n=&gt;-Taye Diggs.\n\nDirector.\n=&gt;-William Malone.\n\nReturn To House On Haunted Hill Unrated.\nThe editor of a fashion magazine Ariel Wolfe receives many calls from her \nsister Sara, but she does not return.
