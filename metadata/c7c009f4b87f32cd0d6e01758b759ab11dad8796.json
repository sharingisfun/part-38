Then I cut and merge the parts with &quot;DVR-MS Editor&quot; 1.2.\nAfterwards the file is converted with PowerDirector 8 to mpg since I think,\nit is the most popular format everybody can handle.\n\nHope, you enjoy my CabRide-torrents and share it to others.\nPlease keep seeding.\n\n*******************************************************************************","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c7c009f4b87f32cd0d6e01758b759ab11dad8796","amp;dn":"Trains.Germany.Koblenz.to.Saarbruecken.1995.CabRide.dTV.SVCD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c7c009f4b87f32cd0d6e01758b759ab11dad8796","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,192,9,244,184,127,50,205,13,110,1,117,139,117,154,177,29,173,135,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
