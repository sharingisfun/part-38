He intends to replace the field with a sports and &quot;cultural&quot; center, along with a large parking lot. The only overt opposition to this plan at the outset comes from an environmentally sensitive grammar school teacher (Fabrice Luchini), and he's hardly a threat, because he doesn't imagine he can successfully oppose the builders' designs. Meanwhile, the mayor has fallen in love with one of the local representatives of the intelligentsia, a woman novelist (Arielle Dombasle). Trouble begins to percolate into the mayor's life and thwart his plans when his daughter and the daughter of the schoolteacher become friends. \n\n   General\n      Complete name : L'arbre, le maire et la mediatheque.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      Format/Family : RIFF\n      File size : 806 MiB\n      PlayTime : 1h 45mn\n      Bit rate : 1057 Kbps\n      StreamSize : 15.0 MiB\n      Writing application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\n      Writing library : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\n      IAS1 : EspaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±ol\n      IAS2 : FranÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§ais\n   Video #0\n      Codec : XviD\n      Codec/Family : MPEG-4\n      Codec/Info : XviD project\n      Codec profile : Simple Profile/Level 3\n      Codec settings/PacketBitStream : No\n      Codec settings/BVOP : Yes\n      Codec settings/QPel : No\n      Codec settings/GMC : 0\n      Codec settings/Matrix : Default\n      PlayTime : 1h 45mn\n      Bit rate : 724 Kbps\n      Width : 640 pixels\n      Height : 480 pixels\n      Display Aspect ratio : 4/3\n      Frame rate : 25.000 fps\n      Resolution : 8 bits\n      Chroma : 4:2:0\n      Interlacement : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.092\n      StreamSize : 547 MiB\n   Audio #1\n      Codec : AC3\n      PlayTime : 1h 45mn\n      Bit rate : 191 Kbps\n      Bit rate mode : CBR\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Channel positions : L R\n      Sampling rate : 48 KHz\n      StreamSize : 145 MiB\n   Audio #2\n      Codec : MPEG-1 Audio layer 3\n      Codec profile : Joint stereo\n      PlayTime : 1h 45mn\n      Bit rate : 131 Kbps\n      Bit rate mode : VBR\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Sampling rate : 48 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      StreamSize : 99.2 MiB\n      Writing library : LAME3.90.\n      Encoding settings : ABR\n\nIMDB: tt0106301\n\nDual audio: channel 1 Spanish, channel 2 French\n\nEnglish, Spanish and Portuguese subtitles\n\nPosted originally at Karagarga","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:53b21a558b8c80628a92bb7c5354fd71844d5ad5","amp;dn":"Eric+Rohmer+-+L%5C%27arbre%2C+le+maire+et+la+mediatheque+%281993%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"53b21a558b8c80628a92bb7c5354fd71844d5ad5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,178,26,85,139,140,128,98,138,146,187,124,83,84,253,113,132,77,90,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
