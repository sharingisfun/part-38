This is an awesome anime, and the composer/artist for the music in this anime is just as awesome. Jeff Williams is an awesome guy making sweet tunes for this anime and for rooster teeth in general. His Daughter Casey Lee Williams is featured in all of these songs, and she has an angelic, beautiful voice, being the final touch all of these songs need. These songs include:\n\nRed Like Roses - Red Trailer\n\nMirror Mirror -  White Trailer\n\nFrom Shadows  -  Black Trailer\n\nI Burn     -     Yellow Trailer\n\nIf You need any kind of music that is hard to find on the internet, shout it out in the comments and I will find what you're looking for. I have been doing this for a couple of years unfortunately. I need to get paid more *sigh*.\n\n-TalkingMuff1n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da35e2ddf3a50fda37b31a5d8f319f93c1f6d76f","amp;dn":"RWBY+Official+Singles","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da35e2ddf3a50fda37b31a5d8f319f93c1f6d76f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,53,226,221,243,165,15,218,55,179,26,93,143,49,159,147,193,246,215,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
