Standard antivirus programs are good at detecting this Malware, but not always so good at effectively removing it. Trojan Remover is designed specifically to disable/remove Malware without the user having to manually edit system files or the Registry. The program also removes the additional system modifications some Malware carries out which are ignored by standard antivirus and trojan scanners.\n\nOS: Windows 2000/XP/Vista/7\nHome Page: www.simplysup.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c7cc2895ed8cccf92aad11a59a02075e2ca7ec4","amp;dn":"Trojan+Remover+6.8.4.2607","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c7cc2895ed8cccf92aad11a59a02075e2ca7ec4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,124,194,137,94,216,204,207,146,170,209,26,89,160,32,117,226,202,126,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
