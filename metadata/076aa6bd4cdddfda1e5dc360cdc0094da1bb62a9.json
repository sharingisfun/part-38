Briggs was the first British winner of the Tournemire Prize at the St AlbanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s International Organ Improvisation Competition. He is Organist Emeritus of Gloucester Cathedral, where he directed the music for eight years. He is renowned worldwide for his brilliant improvisations and is also a prolific composer.\n\nThis disc includes BriggsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Messe pour Notre Dame, and features four movements of David BriggsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ own improvisationsÃ¢â‚¬â€the IntroÃƒÂ¯t, Offertoire, Ãƒâ€°lÃƒÂ©vation and Sortie. Very much aligned with French liturgical practice, this is Briggs captured in the heat of the improvised, unedited moment. These improvisations display a masterful range of mood and colour. There is delicacy, reflection and repose, alongside mighty bombast and truly gothic Ã¢â‚¬Ëœshock and aweÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. Listening to them is an uniquely thrilling musical experience.\n\nAlso included are some of BriggsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ much more Anglophone anthems. The Choir of Trinity College, Cambridge, who have been winning increasing praise for their Hyperion recordings, perform with their inspirational director Stephen Layton, and the composer, of course, at the organ.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:076aa6bd4cdddfda1e5dc360cdc0094da1bb62a9","amp;dn":"David+Briggs+-+Mass+for+Notre+Dame+%282010%29+%5Bflac%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"076aa6bd4cdddfda1e5dc360cdc0094da1bb62a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,106,166,189,76,221,223,218,30,93,195,96,205,192,9,77,161,187,98,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
