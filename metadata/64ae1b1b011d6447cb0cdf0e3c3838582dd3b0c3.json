Their 1990 Alligator CD is still Saffire's best all-around recording. Even overlooking the novelty of three women giving a female and middle-aged slant to the blues, this is a highly enjoyable and musical set. Assisted on three numbers by Mark Wenner's harmonica, Saffire plays spirited versions of such tunes as &quot;Middle Aged Blues Boogie,&quot; &quot;Even Yuppies Get the Blues,&quot; &quot;Fess Up When You Mess Up,&quot; &quot;I Almost Lost My Mind&quot; and their theme &quot;Wild Women Don't Have the Blues.&quot; Recommended. (AllMusic Scott Yanow)\n\nThe group's fundamental appeal -- to growing numbers of music fans who don't know much about blues -- is their original songs and their ability to dig up and reinterpret old blues gems from the 1920s and '30s. They specialize in songs made by the sassy original blues divas including Bessie Smith, Ma Rainey, Memphis Minnie, and Ida Cox. (AllMusic Richard Skelly)\n\nTrack list:\n1.
