Each volume is a two disc set. Each volume covers a three-year interval; the first volume begins with 1934 and the fourth volume ends with 1945. The entire collection was released by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment on October 30, 2007, and marked the first time the team's shorts were released on DVD in chronological order.
