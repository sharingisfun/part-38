Beers (Cambridge University Press, 2007).pdf\n\nISBN 978-0-521-85971-4\n\nSuitable for a first year graduate course, this textbook unites the applications of numerical mathematics and scientific computing to the practice of chemical engineering. Written in a pedagogic style, the book describes basic linear and nonlinear algebric systems all the way through to stochastic methods, Bayesian statistics and parameter estimation. These subjects are developed at a level of mathematics suitable for graduate engineering study without the exhaustive level of the theoretical mathematical detail. The implementation of numerical methods in MATLAB is integrated within each chapter and numerous examples in chemical engineering are provided, with a library of corresponding MATLAB programs. This book will provide the graduate student with essential tools required by industry and research alike","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f0993735083ee27a7972e8a8e9918e526e7ad81","amp;dn":"Numerical+Methods+for+Chemical+Engineering+-+Applications+in+MAT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f0993735083ee27a7972e8a8e9918e526e7ad81","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,9,147,115,80,131,238,39,167,151,46,138,142,153,24,229,38,231,173,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
