Armed with his unlimited credit card and the singular goal of bringing a little U.S. citizen back to Beijing, Jiajia knows how to play this game of modern love. But when Jiajia arrives in Seattle, the city which inspired her favorite movie Sleepless in Seattle, nothing goes right: she's stuck sharing a small house with two other pregnant ladies, she has trouble reaching her boyfriend on the phone, and eventually, even the credit card stops working. To top that off, the only person willing to spend time with her is her driver Frank. Frank is the opposite of everything she ever wanted in a man... or could he be exactly the kind of guy she really needs?\n\n\nFile\nQuality: BDRip 720p\nFormat: MKV\nVideo Codec: x264\nAudio Codec: AAC\nVideo: 1280 x 544, 24 fps,\nAudio: Mandarin, 48.100 kHz, AAC, 2 ch\n\nSubtitles: English (Softcoded)\nÃÅ¸ÃÂµÃ‘â‚¬ÃÂµÃÂ²ÃÂ¾ÃÂ´: ÃÅ¾Ã‘â€šÃ‘ï¿½Ã‘Æ’Ã‘â€šÃ‘ï¿½Ã‘â€šÃÂ²Ã‘Æ’ÃÂµÃ‘â€š","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:acb3b5caf23513aac94464f62004794927bc6d05","amp;dn":"Finding+Mr+Right+%5B2013%5D+720p+%5BChi%5D-Junoon","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"acb3b5caf23513aac94464f62004794927bc6d05","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,179,181,202,242,53,19,170,201,68,100,246,32,4,121,73,39,188,109,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
