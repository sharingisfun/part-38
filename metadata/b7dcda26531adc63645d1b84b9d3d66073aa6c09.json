The result, on early hits like &quot;Dance To The Music&quot;, &quot;M'Lady&quot;, &quot;Stand&quot; and &quot;Everyday People&quot;, was some of most gleeful, high-spirited and uplifting music ever made. \nLater, as the 1960s gave way to the long hangover of the 70s and Stone himself descended into drug abuse, sophisticated songs like &quot;If You Want Me To Stay&quot; and &quot;Family Affair&quot; took on a melancholic, reflective tinge, while a sharp political edge found its way into &quot;Runnin' Away&quot; and &quot;Don't Call Me Nigger, Whitey&quot;. Genius through and through. (Amazon)\n\n\n\n\nAll the classic are here including the sublime &quot;Family Affair&quot; the underrated &quot;If You Want Me to Stay&quot; and the strangely influential &quot;Sing a Simple Song&quot; (which was actually originally released as the UK B side of the also influential &quot;Everyday People&quot; - yes, that's here too). We also have makeweight stuff like the unattractive &quot;M'Lady&quot; - a cynical, nearly note for note remake of &quot;Dance to the Music&quot;.\n\nSo lots of styles, lots of seminal stuff and well worth another spin if you want to understand one of the more important steps along the way to how disco/dance music got to where it is today.
