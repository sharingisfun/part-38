His talent was revealed relatively late on his life, from the seventies on, when he gave a series of concerts in Paris with his group of the time, a vocal quartet known as &quot; The Muezzins of Aleppo &quot;. Ever since then he has received constant requests from abroad, has been appointed principal muezzin of the city and was even decorated in 1996 by Farouk Hosni, the Egyptian Minister of Culture.\n\nHis lack of interest in promoting his art has actually handicapped him in the past to such an extent that his name is not even to be found amongst those quoted in the two key works on contemporary Syrian music, by AdnÃƒÂ¢n Bin Dhurayl (Damascus 1988) and SamÃƒÂ®m al-SharÃƒÂ®f (Damascus, 1991). Sabri Moudallal was one of Syria's greatest vocal artists, with a prodigious output as a composer. He has taken the art of the flourish to its highest degree, even developing a vocal technique enabling him to take his breath whilst singing. Although he remained a faithful adept of the sacred song, he was equally at home in the secular repertory. In spite of his great age, he was still pursuing his career. He was a pupil of Umar al-Batsch himself, and his great speciality was the wasla, of which he was a true master in every aspect, down to the most minute detail. Like his master he had also put his hand and skill to composition in the traditional style. There are several very beautiful songs by his hand ; two of these &quot; Ahmad yÃƒÂ¢ habibi &quot; and &quot; IlÃƒÂ¢hÃƒÂ® &quot; have been recorded for &quot; The Aleppian Music Room &quot;. Sabri Moudalal passed away in August 2006.
