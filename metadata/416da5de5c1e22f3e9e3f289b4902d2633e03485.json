We just made it better.\n\nThe original multilayer parallax app!\n\nUnique and one of the kind live wallpaper you won't find anywhere else - Multi-Layered parallax backgrounds!\nGive your homescreen a real 3D depth with gyroscope controlled multi-layered parallax backgrounds - even better than effect featured on Iphone iOS 7.\n\nYou can even use you own layers and share them with other users through shared dropbox folder accessible from within the app! We already have more than 15 additional themes submitted by users.\n\nUnlike other live wallpapers which just move one flat background image - this live wallpaper combines few background layers, reacting to your device's gyroscope rotation and tilting to give the best illusion experience.\nCompare and see the difference for yourself.\n\n[b]Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ fully 3D OpenGL gyroscope controlled environment\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ completely new and unique feature you won't find anywhere else even on Iphone - multi-layered parallax\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ download or create your own multi-layers! To share your own creations with other users please email us and we will share it in public dropbox folder. Please use 1024x1024 or 2048x2048 transparent PNG files.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ 5 included unique multi-layered backgrounds for better depth illusion - more coming soon.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ rotating backgrounds to match your device's rotation in all axis\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ same 3D depth effect as seen on Iphone iOS 7\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ configure the levels of depth effect\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ use your own custom image or choose from included backgrounds set (please use default gallery application to select own image as we're working on adding support for 3rd party apps like quickpix, dropbox etc)\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ smooth and battery efficent\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ has an option to use only accelerometer sensor which uses 10 times less power than other sensors for super extra power save (not really neccessary)\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ when not visible application is completely stopped, it doesn't run anything in background\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ use custom launchers like Nova or Apex to have this wallpaper visible in your app drawer as well[/b]\n\nPlease use export option and save to sd card when on mobile dropbox site or enable &quot;Request desktop site&quot; option in your browser when downloading layers from dropbox. Otherwise all downloaded images will be smaller resolution than required. This is being investigated now.\n\n***bear in mind this is an optical illusion so may not appeal to everyone so dont't blame the app, in case you don't like the effect uninstall the app within 15 minutes and your order will be refunded automatically by Google.\n\nREAD/WRITE EXTERNAL STORAGE permission is being used for choosing own backgrounds\n\nIn demo video Apex launcher was used with transparent apps drawer setting\n\n\n[b]Requires Android - 2.3 and up [/b]\n\n[b]Installation Notes :-[/b]\n\n*Unzip the downloaded torrent file\n\n*Copy and paste the apk file into sd_card of your android mobile\n\n* Install it in your mobile.\n\n[b]For more info :- https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vinwap.parallaxwallpaper[/b]\n\n[b]Screen :-[/b]\n\n\n[img]http://s28.postimg.org/93hz9yh3x/aaaaa.jpg[/img]\n\n\n[img]http://s22.postimg.org/bhay4358x/thanks.jpg[/img]\n\n\n[img]http://i.cubeupload.com/x83wjq.gif[/img]\n\n\n[url=http://extratorrent.cc/user/review_add/?user=shilpa143][img]http://s28.postimg.org/4l3jk2ql9/Review.png[/img][/url]\n\n\n[img]http://s28.postimg.org/timog9sil/cooltext1344496247.gif[/img]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:416da5de5c1e22f3e9e3f289b4902d2633e03485","amp;dn":"3D+Parallax+Background+V1.19+%5BANDROID%5D+%7Bshilpa143%7D+-%3D%5BTeam+OS%5D%3D-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"416da5de5c1e22f3e9e3f289b4902d2633e03485","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,109,165,222,92,30,34,243,233,227,242,137,180,144,45,38,51,224,52,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
