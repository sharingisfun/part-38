This release 1998 on Original Jazz Classics.\n\nReview by Al Campbell (AMG)\nJazz soprano saxophone is mainly associated with its originator in the idiom Sidney Bechet and later John Coltrane who brought the instrument into a new realm with the success of &quot;My Favorite Things.&quot; Even though this was the first time Zoot Sims played soprano saxophone exclusively on a date, he sounds comfortable enough with it to be included in that elite category. Originally recorded in 1976, Soprano Sax highlights two Sims originals alongside standards &quot;Moonlight in Vermont,&quot; &quot;Willow Weep for Me,&quot; and &quot;Wrap Your Troubles in Dreams.&quot; Pianist Ray Bryant, bassist George Mraz, and drummer Grady Tate make up the complementary rhythm section behind Sims, who unfortunately never made another all soprano date. \n\n01.
