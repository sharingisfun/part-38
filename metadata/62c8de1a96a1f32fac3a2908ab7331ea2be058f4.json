The versions of Ana Ng, Birdhouse In Your Soul and She's An Angel on this album were all previously featured on 1994's They Might Be Giants Live!! NYC EP. (Although, the &quot;I don't want the world&quot; part of Ana Ng was modified for STD.) Also contained on the album were a series of live songs centered around The Planet Of The Apes. The tracks were taken from fan-submitted bootlegs of the shows they were played at, as the band hadn't originally planned to immortalize the improvised songs. These tracks were also originally &quot;hidden tracks&quot; on the CD release, as the back of the CD doesn't list them and they play after 2:20 minutes of silence at the end of the track About Me.\n\nAlthough ostensibly a live album, it contains 3 studio tracks: Doctor Worm, Severe Tire Damage Theme, and About Me. Doctor Worm was released as a single in the UK and also saw a promotional release in the United States. Although it was never released as a true single in the US, it remains a fan favorite, and is one of TMBG's most played songs in live shows.\n\nThe album debuted on the Billboard 200 albums chart the week of August 29, 1998, and spent one week on the chart, peaking at number 186.\n\nIn 1999, the album was released in a stripped-down version, simply known as Live. It features only 10 of this album's 24 tracks.\n********************************************************************","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:62c8de1a96a1f32fac3a2908ab7331ea2be058f4","amp;dn":"They+Might+Be+Giants+-+Severe+Tire+Damage+%281998%29+193+kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"62c8de1a96a1f32fac3a2908ab7331ea2be058f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,200,222,26,150,161,243,47,172,58,41,8,171,115,49,234,43,224,88,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
