Sue, a carpenter by trade, struggles to keep the bailiffs at bay while trying to find a way to give her daughters a holiday to remember. And Julie, burdened with a weight problem and a family tragedy, turns to local weight loss guru Linda to help her deal with both. \r\nWhile many Valleys residents are living a hand-to-mouth existence, some businesses are thriving. Linda's slimming class does a roaring trade in this obesity hotspot while pawnbroker David turns a tidy profit off the back of other people's need.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/0a/Life-in-Debt-Valley-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/8a/Life-in-Debt-Valley-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b4/Life-in-Debt-Valley-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a9/Life-in-Debt-Valley-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/ff/Life-in-Debt-Valley-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b3/Life-in-Debt-Valley-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a0/Life-in-Debt-Valley-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/08/Life-in-Debt-Valley-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/2e/Life-in-Debt-Valley-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e8/Life-in-Debt-Valley-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/90/Life-in-Debt-Valley-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/7c/Life-in-Debt-Valley-Screen11.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 3002 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 59mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 1\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 1.28 GB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\nRelease Notes\r\nMerged English Subtitles\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b075vylw","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:05c504f53a52b0562173d558599e50b89d5ac290","amp;dn":"BBC+Life+in+Debt+Valley+720p+x264+AAC+HDTV+MVGroup.org","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"05c504f53a52b0562173d558599e50b89d5ac290","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,197,4,245,58,82,176,86,33,115,213,88,89,158,80,184,157,90,194,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
