The last remnants of privacy and intimacy have been swept away in what appears to be a logical progression of the explosive growth of social networks at the beginning of the 21st century. The citizens themselves have accepted this surveillance society in exchange for the comfort only smart technology can provide. This memory economy gives immense power over society to just a handful of people.\n\nRemember MeÃ¢â€žÂ¢ is a 3rd person action adventure where players take on the role of Nilin, a former elite memory hunter with the ability to break into peopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s minds and steal or even alter their memories. The authorities, fearful of her knowledge and capabilities arrested Nilin and wiped her memory clean. After her escape from prison, Nilin sets out on a mission to recover her identity, helped by her last and only friend. This search for her past leads to her being hunted by the very people that created this surveillance society.\n\nKey Features\n\nSpeculative, stunning vision of our future Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Discover Neo-Paris 2084, where augmented reality and memory digitisation have taken control of peoplesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ lives.\n\nPlay as Nilin Ã¢â‚¬â€œ an elite memory hunter with a clouded past Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Become the most wanted memory hunter in Neo-Paris and experience the power to break into peoplesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ minds to steal their memories.
