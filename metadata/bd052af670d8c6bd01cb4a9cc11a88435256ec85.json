They learned a few important things while they had taken a short sabbatical -- they knew that hooks were important and they knew they could play up their looks for MTV. So, they delivered both with Heart, giving their audience anthemic hooks and tightly  corseted bosoms, leading to the most popular album they ever had. This doesn&amp;#039;t mean it&amp;#039;s the best, since its calculated mainstream bent may disarm some long-term fans, but it is true that they do this better than many of their peers, not just because  they have good polished material from professional songwriters but because they can deliver this material professionally themselves. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd052af670d8c6bd01cb4a9cc11a88435256ec85","amp;dn":"Heart-Heart-%28Retail%29-1985-HHI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd052af670d8c6bd01cb4a9cc11a88435256ec85","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,5,42,246,112,216,198,189,1,203,74,156,193,26,136,67,82,86,236,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
