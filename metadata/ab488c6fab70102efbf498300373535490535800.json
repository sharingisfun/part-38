L.A. Times reporter McDermott has dug deep, interviewing scores of friends, relatives and officials worldwide and trawling through troves of documents.\n\nEngrossing and deeply disturbing from the start, the book begins with two events Americans rarely connect: Russia's retreat from Afghanistan in 1989, followed in 1990 by Western troops pouring into Saudi Arabia after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. McDermott shows victory in Afghanistan electrifying Islamic warriors who hated Christianity as much as communism; a new &quot;infidel&quot; army to fight proved an irresistible challenge.\n\nFor McDermott, this moment marks the beginning of organized, nonstate-supported terrorism. Not very organized, he adds, describing half a dozen plots cobbled together by clumsy enthusiasts who were often caught--though often too late.\n\nDespite the media attention paid to bin Laden, McDermott paints him not as the fÃƒÂ¼hrer of terrorism, but as a rich leader with the most aggressive P.R. Bin Laden, for example had nothing to do with the first attack on the World Trade Center in 1993--but he was inspired by it. McDermott's detailed biographies of the hijackers go far beyond the characterizations of the 9/11 report, and he is skeptical of accounts that portray them as deeply disturbed: all came from intact families, most were middle-class, few were deeply religious, none were abused or estranged. Recruited for the hijackings and informed they would die, they thought it over and agreed. McDermott's clear rendering of that decision is just one of this book's strengths.\n\nAuthor: Terry McDermott\nPublisher: HarperCollins e-books\nPublication Date: October 13, 2009\n\nFormats:\n.mobi (compatible with Amazon Kindle, etc.)\n.epub (compatible with Sony Reader, Cruz Reader, iPad, iPodTouch/iPhone, etc.)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab488c6fab70102efbf498300373535490535800","amp;dn":"Terry+McDermott+-+Perfect+Soldiers%3A+The+9%2F11+Hijackers+%28mobi%2B%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab488c6fab70102efbf498300373535490535800","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,72,140,111,171,112,16,46,251,244,152,48,3,115,83,84,144,83,88,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
