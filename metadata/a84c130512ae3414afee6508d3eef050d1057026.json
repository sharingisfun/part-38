YOU!! HINDU AWAKE!\n\nWRITTEN BY\nDR. CHATTERJEE\nMA., Ph.D. (U.S.A.)\n\n\nThis book is not meant for decorating your bookshelf, but for circulation among\nothers as fast as you can so\nthat we can save our MOTHERINDIA\n\n\nFOREWORD\nTo write a foreword to Oh! You Hindu!! Awake!!!, I accepted this offer with shock and\nsurprise. Remember this is not an ordinary book. My blood started boiling as I read\nit for the first time. Anybody reading this book with an unbiased mind will certainly\nagree with the facts and figures given in this booklet. Since I didn't believe this book\nas it is at first. I asked for the video cassettes and books mentioned at the end. To my\ngreat surprise, as a Hindu, I don't know what to write further. Whenever anything is\nwritten on Hinduism, it is hidden from the public because of the power and media\nthey have.\n\nWhat have their books and religions taught us? How many Gods have we? Who are\nour Gods? Can you believe Ramayana &amp; Mahabaratha? What are they telling about\nour Godly men viz. Rama, Sita, Shiva Parvathi, Brahma, Ganesh &amp; Krishna? Can one\nnot see the pornography and incest in them? I would not read it to my mother,\ndaughter or sister! Can you? What if a foreigner asks us what is Lingam and Yoni? How\nabout Shankaracharya, Rajaneesh, Sai Baba, Maharishis, Dhirendra Brahmachari and\nProof Chinmayananda? What are our Puranas and Veda telling? Our claims about\nViboothi, sun worshiping, urine drinking and other blind faiths tell us how ignorant\nwe are. How do we treat our Indian women? But we laugh at the treatment of women\nin other religions. What hypocrites we are? How dare a rich go inside the temple with\nspecial respect even if he is anillicit liquor dealer or smuggler while thousands of\npeople are waiting in the queue?\nAlso religion is a 'man to God' and 'man to man' relationship. But to reach God,\ntreating the! Fellow human beings with love, justice and equal right is the best way.\nMost of the religions are preaching the same way.\n\nUnfortunately only Hinduism which was originated by the Brahmins is preaching that\nto reach God you must not love your fellow human being, you should not treat him\nwith justice and you should not treat him with equal rights and humanity. On the\nother hand it teaches the high caste Brahmin how to enslave him, cheat him and fool\nhim in the name of Hinduism. With this technique only today 2% Brahmins are ruling\n89% of India's population.\nDo you think the master race will change itself? Impossible. Why? Because they will\nbreak into pieces if YOU know the real truth! You and I cannot change our\nMOTHERLAND overnight But let us do something that we can.\n-DR.
