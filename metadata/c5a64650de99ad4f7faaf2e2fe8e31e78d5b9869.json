However, in recent years, due to his actions against Hope - the Mutant Messiah - Bishop has been branded a traitor and pariah and up until very recently he was stranded in the distant future. This collection examines Bishop in far better times, along with links to some other seminal works featuring him. This pack contains:\n\nUncanny X-Men 281-283, &quot;Bishop's Crossing&quot; (1991) - His first appearance, from the future.\n\nBishop 01-04 (1994) - The first miniseries looking at Bishop's role in the X-Men.\n\nXSE (Xavier's Security Enforcers) 01-04 (1996) - Future X-Team? Of course it has Bishop!\n\nBishop - XSE 01-03 (1998) - A sequel to the above miniseries.\n\nTeam X 2000 01 (1999, One-Shot) - Bishop and Deathbird's relationship examined.\n\nBishop, The Last X-Man 01-05 (1999-2000) - Short-lived and rarely torrented series about Bishop's separation from the X-Men and his quest to find them again. Good stuff.\n\nGambit &amp; Bishop: Genesis (2001) - A reprint collection looking at these two friends and good-natured rivals.\n\nGambit &amp; Bishop: Sons of the Atom 00-06 (2001) - A nice miniseries with - wait for it - Gambit and Bishop. Shocker!\n\nX-Treme X-Men 01 and 2001 Annual (2001) - Bishop's last team prior to Civil War with some cool bits about his powers in both these issues.\n\nI will add some links in the comments box below - if you like this stuff then definitely check them out for a lot more Bishop! All thanks to the original uploaders and scanners, and as always please seed and enjoy! :-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c5a64650de99ad4f7faaf2e2fe8e31e78d5b9869","amp;dn":"X-Men+Profiles+-+The+Bishop+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c5a64650de99ad4f7faaf2e2fe8e31e78d5b9869","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,166,70,80,222,153,173,79,127,170,242,226,254,142,49,231,141,91,152,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
