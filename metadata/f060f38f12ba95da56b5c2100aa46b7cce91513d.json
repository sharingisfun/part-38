The band's buzzy guitar riffs, gossamer vocals, and swaths of synthesized distortion (the duo filtered their keyboards through a death metal pedal) gave a nod to early-'90s acts like Tender Trap, the Softies, and My Bloody Valentine. The duo handed out their debut handmade CD-R EP, Paper Airplanes, at their live shows in 2006, and they self-released their first full-length album, She Dares All Things, the following year. Panda Riot brought a couple new members into the fold, bassist Justin and drummer Melissa, soon after their full-length debut was released; Melissa soon parted ways with the band, and drummer Jose was brought on board to round out the group's sound. Panda Riot's sophomore EP, Far &amp; Near, was released on the Mirror/Mirror label in 2010. The band's profile enjoyed a healthy boost in 2011 when they made an appearance at the 2011 New York Popfest, sharing the stage with like-minded indie pop acts Silver Swans, the Motifs, and Kids on a Crime Spree.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f060f38f12ba95da56b5c2100aa46b7cce91513d","amp;dn":"Panda+Riot+-+Northern+Automatic+Music+%282013%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f060f38f12ba95da56b5c2100aa46b7cce91513d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,96,243,143,18,186,149,218,86,181,194,16,10,164,107,124,206,145,81,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
