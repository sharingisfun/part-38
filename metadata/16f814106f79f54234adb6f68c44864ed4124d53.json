Consequently his singing is somewhat strained and he plays guitar on only one track, but he compensates by playing lots of harmonica, rooted in style of 40-years-earlier buddies like Little Walter. Steve Freund and John Primer and Barrelhouse Chuck use their space effectively, and altogether this is a pleasing recital of oldfashioned Chicago band music.\nSince a serious stroke had largely robbed Myers of his revered ability to play guitar, this effort really isn't indicative of his vast talent. But you've got to give him points for courage -- Myers summoned up the strength to play harp and sing on what would be his final release. A nice Chicago combo that included guitarists Steve Freund and John Primer undoubtedly put Myers's mind at ease. ~ Bill Dahl\n\nTracklist\n1. Wiggle Tail - 5:49\n2. Blue And Lonesome - 6:26\n3.
