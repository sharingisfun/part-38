Created by comics historian Rick Marschall, it was published in the 1980s by Fantagraphics.\n\nNemo ran for 31 issues (the last being a double issue) plus one annual. Most issues were edited by Marschall. The title was taken from the classic comic strip Little Nemo. While some issues were thematic, most were a mix of articles, interviews, comic strip reprints and more.\n\nMarschall later went on to co-found another magazine about comics, Hogan's Alley.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nemo,_the_Classic_Comics_Library&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nemo,_the_Classic_Comics_Library&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e531102021df0403ecc08abe1b220359ef60cee","amp;dn":"Nemo+-+The+Classic+Comics+Library","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e531102021df0403ecc08abe1b220359ef60cee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,83,17,2,2,29,240,64,62,204,8,171,225,178,32,53,158,246,12,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
