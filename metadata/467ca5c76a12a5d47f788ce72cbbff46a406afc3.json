Antelman is a 2 Volume book set which contains so much unknown information that one may ask how its possible that a single individual could have retrieved all this. If there's a holy covenant for knowledge and wisdom, Rabbi Antelman must have been carrying it around all his lifetime. A competing organization wich has access to even more &quot;unknown&quot; information, are of course The Jesuits and their Vatican Library. Interesting enough, Antelman barely mentions the Jesuits as the &quot;evil-do-ers&quot; inside his two Volumes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:467ca5c76a12a5d47f788ce72cbbff46a406afc3","amp;dn":"Rabbi+Marvin+Antelman+To+Eliminate+The+Opiate+vol1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"467ca5c76a12a5d47f788ce72cbbff46a406afc3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,124,165,199,106,18,165,212,127,120,140,231,44,187,255,70,164,6,175,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
