Frontman Billy Corgan is the group's primary songwriterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½his grand musical ambitions and cathartic lyrics have shaped the band's albums and songs, which have been described as &quot;anguished, bruised reports from Billy Corgan's nightmare-land&quot;.[3]\n\nThe Smashing Pumpkins broke into the musical mainstream with their second album, Siamese Dream (1993). The group built its audience with extensive touring and their follow-up, the double album Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness (1995), debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 album chart. With approximately 18.25 million albums sold in the United States alone,[4] The Smashing Pumpkins were one of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed bands of the 1990s.[5] However, internal fighting, drug use, and diminishing record sales hampered the band and led to a 2000 break-up. In April 2006, the band officially announced that it was reuniting and recording a new album. Returning members Billy Corgan and Jimmy Chamberlin were joined by musicians Jeff Schroeder (guitar/vocals), Ginger Reyes (bass/vocals), and Lisa Harriton (keyboard/vocals) in 2007 to tour in support of their new release, Zeitgeist. In March 2009, Corgan announced that Chamberlin had left the band, but that he would continue to record and perform without him under the band name.\n\n\nDiscography:\n\nGish (1991) \nSiamese Dream (1993) \nMellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness (1995) \nAdore (1998) \nMachina/The Machines of God (2000) \nMachina II/The Friends &amp; Enemies of Modern Music (2000) \nZeitgeist (2007) \n\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\nand seed, mkay? harrr..\n-rgh.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ef4ca33969e0d055ee606c888983d3d47830a67","amp;dn":"The+Smashing+Pumpkins+Discography+%281991-2007%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ef4ca33969e0d055ee606c888983d3d47830a67","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,244,202,51,150,158,13,5,94,230,6,200,136,152,61,61,71,131,10,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
