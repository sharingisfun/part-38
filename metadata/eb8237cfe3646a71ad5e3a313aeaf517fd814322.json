The album was recorded in 1999 and released on March 7, 2000. The album peaked at number 29 on the Billboard 200 chart and it has spent a total of 103 weeks on that chart, as of June 2010. \n\nThe Sickness has been certified 4x Platinum by the RIAA, with around 4,248,000 copies sold in the United States alone as of 2011, making it the band's most successful album. It is one of three Disturbed albums to have the Parental Advisory label and contain high amounts of profanity and the explicit content of the song &quot;Down with the Sickness&quot;.\n\nUnlike Disturbed's later albums, which are mixed in style, The Sickness consists primarily of heavier songs. In addition, The Sickness includes much more profanity, darker lyrical themes, and more electronic elements than later Disturbed albums.\n\nMP3 - 320kbs\n  \nNo. \t\n1. \t&quot;Voices&quot;   \t        \t     3:11\n2. \t&quot;The Game&quot;   \t         \t     3:46\n3. \t&quot;Stupify&quot;   \t  \t             4:34\n4. \t&quot;Down with the Sickness&quot;       \t     4:38\n5. \t&quot;Violence Fetish&quot;   \t  \t     3:23\n6. \t&quot;Fear&quot;   \t  \t             3:46\n7. \t&quot;Numb&quot;   \t  \t             3:44\n8. \t&quot;Want&quot;   \t  \t             3:52\n9. \t&quot;Conflict&quot;   \t          \t     4:35\n10. \t&quot;Shout 2000&quot; (Tears for Fears cover) 4:17\n11. \t&quot;Droppin' Plates&quot;   \t  \t     3:48\n12. \t&quot;Meaning of Life&quot;   \t  \t     4:01\n\n13.     &quot;God Of The Mind&quot;                    3:03\n14.     &quot;Stupify (Live)&quot;                     4:53\n15.     &quot;The Game (Live)&quot;                    3:52\n16.     &quot;Voices (Live)&quot;                      3:36\n17.     &quot;Down With The Sickness (Live)&quot;      6:16\n\nPlease Dont Hit And Run !\n\nAnd Please Feel free to Comment, Reguest and tell me what you like :D","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb8237cfe3646a71ad5e3a313aeaf517fd814322","amp;dn":"Disturbed+-2000-+The+Sickness+%28Special+Edition%29%5B320kbs%5D%7E%7ERenovat","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb8237cfe3646a71ad5e3a313aeaf517fd814322","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,130,55,207,227,100,106,113,173,94,58,49,58,234,245,23,253,129,67,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
