Somehow things didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t go so smoothly for super-scientist Dick Ã¢â‚¬Å“SharkbiterÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Hawke.\n\nNow trapped in a world beyond his understanding and at war with a global empire, he must fight monsters, madness, and killer clowns to set things right, save the girl, and bring evil to its knees.\n\nAbout the blue whale:\nThe blue whale is the largest creature ever to inhabit the earth. It has blood vessels so large that a full grown adult human who makes really poor decisions could swim through them. They are blue, or so their name implies, and also mammals. For more information on blue whales, look them up on the Internet.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:47427c3437800826ebfbec2530c739162d59097a","amp;dn":"Richard+Partridge%27s+Hawke%27s+Doom+%28Hilarious+Sci-Fi+Novel%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"47427c3437800826ebfbec2530c739162d59097a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,66,124,52,55,128,8,38,235,251,236,37,48,199,57,22,45,89,9,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
