An exemplary takeoff from DÃƒÂ¼sseldorfÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s runways 23L heading south. Via the so-called takeoff route KUMI T1, we then head towards Frankfurt and, as we set course for Vienna, the sun starts to set in an unreal deep red only known from kitschy Hollywood films!\n\nOver eastern Turkey, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s time for a nice slice of Sache chocolate cake and a freshly brewed cup of coffee, while copilot Stefan Kater gives us a detailed explanation of the navigation display and its readings. He elucidates, for example, the calculations needed to allow for wind shear from different directions and why a second aircraft on the same route has been flying for so long directly beneath us (600 meters).\n\nJoe Moser gives us a brief introduction to kerosene prices while Stefan prepares meticulously for the approachÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ the landing in Male. The single runway looks from a distance like an aircraft carrier because the airport engulfs almost the entire island.\n\nAfter the flight, we are rewarded with a five minute circuit flight over the archipelago, the TwinOtter of the local Maldives Airtaxi company also being piloted by our captain Joe Moser. And as the icing on the cake, we get some unique footage of the aircraft landing in Munich: the helicopter Ã¢â‚¬â€œ piloted by another LTU captain Peter Thoma Ã¢â‚¬â€œ was able to cover the landing Airbus as it approaches and sets down on the runway, showing Munich Airport from a fully new perspective.\n\n\nUnfortunately due to limitations of the Freemake Video Converter, I don't know how to include more than one subtitle in the file, so only English is available.\n\nFile is 1080p with the standard German/English audio and English subtitles.\n\nFellow aviation lovers, enjoy!\n\nUploaded by SDF","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4f0d3c4cac28fff0a9ae0269871d421ac781209","amp;dn":"PilotsEYE.tv+-+Malediven+A332","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c4f0d3c4cac28fff0a9ae0269871d421ac781209","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,240,211,196,202,194,143,255,10,154,224,38,152,113,212,33,172,120,18,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
