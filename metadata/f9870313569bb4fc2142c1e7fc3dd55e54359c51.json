While definitely a product of its time, Walter and Louise Simonson keep the plot moving forward and have fun with the pairing. The real treat is the art though - Kent Williams and Jon J. Muth are render everything in full paint and give the artwork a tactile feeling while also giving the impression that everything is melting, appropriately enough. Thanks to Zone-Empire for this copy, please seed and enjoy! :-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9870313569bb4fc2142c1e7fc3dd55e54359c51","amp;dn":"Havok+%26amp%3B+Wolverine+-+Meltdown+01-04+%281988%2C+Digital%2C+Zone-Empi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9870313569bb4fc2142c1e7fc3dd55e54359c51","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,135,3,19,86,155,180,252,33,66,193,231,252,61,213,94,84,53,156,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
