Word is out that Interpol has excavated the robotic remains of Clockwerk--Sly's nemesis and sworn enemy of the Cooper clan--and it's up to you to prevent it from being reassembled. To do this, you must once again enter the thieving world of pickpocketing, vent crawls, rooftop chases, and stealth attacks. Sly 2: Band of Thieves takes you on an adventure across numerous locations, including Paris, Prague, India, and the Canadian Wilderness.[/quote]\n\nKnown supported languages: English (probably the usual Multi-5)\n\nI have personally tested this with HDLoader 0.8b+ and 0.8c and it works perfectly.\n\nSpecial thanks to Cavalier_Z for the initial upload. I just made a torrent from it. ;)\n\nNote: My previous Sly 2 torrent was erroneous. I think I accidentally changed the .nfo after I made the torrent. Sorry about that. :(","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:95a45ca046a4ef23be65c6a7adbda213f39949bf","amp;dn":"Sly+2+-+Band+of+Thieves","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"95a45ca046a4ef23be65c6a7adbda213f39949bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,164,92,160,70,164,239,35,190,101,198,167,173,189,162,19,243,153,73,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
