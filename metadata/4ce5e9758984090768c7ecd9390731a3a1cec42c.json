Using an impressive variety of instrumentation (stand-up bass, accordion, trumpet, trombone, french horn, euphonium, and CondonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s signature ukulele), the band played a batch of tunes that appropriately ushered the audience to a variety of places around the world. Gulag Orkestar sparked a quick trip to the Balkans. During The Shrew, a song from BeirutÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s brand new EP March of the Zapotec, Mexico became the destination of choice. They also dabbled in a track called My Night With a Prostitute from Marseille; this one from Zach CondonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Realpeoples Holland EP.\nThey ended the show with a cover of a dancy old Brazilian song, written by Ary Barroso called Aquarela do Brasil (Watercolor of Brazil); a lighthearted way to send the happy crowd off into the cold streets of Brooklyn indeed.\n \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ce5e9758984090768c7ecd9390731a3a1cec42c","amp;dn":"Beirut+-+Live+at+the+Music+Hall+of+Williamsburg+%5Bmp3-vbr-2009%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ce5e9758984090768c7ecd9390731a3a1cec42c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,229,233,117,137,132,9,7,104,199,236,217,57,7,49,163,161,206,196,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
