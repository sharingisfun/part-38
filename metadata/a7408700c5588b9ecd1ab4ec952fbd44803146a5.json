Loftus, author of the \n\ncritically acclaimed Why I Became an Atheist, has assembled fifteen outstanding \n\narticles by leading skeptics, expanding on themes introduced in Loftus's first \n\nbook.\n\n\n\nCentral is a defense of Loftus's &quot;outsider's test of faith,&quot; arguing that believers \n\nshould test their faith with the same skeptical standards they use to evaluate the \n\nother faiths they reject, as if they were outsiders. Experts in medicine, \n\npsychology, and anthropology join Loftus to show in four chapters why, when this \n\ntest is applied to Christianity, it becomes very difficult to rationally defend.\n\nThree chapters follow that demonstrate errors and superstitions throughout the \n\nBible, making any claim of the Bible being God's word nearly impossible to sustain. \n\nThen two chapters expose the immorality of the biblical God, with an innovative \n\nargument from animal suffering, and a cogent reply to Christians who attempt to \n\ndefend the depravity of the Bible's God. Three chapters then focus on why it is \n\nunreasonable to believe that Jesus is the risen son of God.\n\n\nFinally, three popular Christian claims are dispatched. The contributors show why \n\nChristianity does not provide the basis for morality, atheism was not the reason \n\nHitler murdered so many, and Christianity was not responsible for modern science. \n\nCollectively, these articles reveal that popular Christian beliefs tend to rely on \n\nignorance of the facts.\n\n\nDrawing together experts in diverse fields, including Hector Avalos, Richard \n\nCarrier, David Eller, and Robert Price, The Christian Delusion deals a powerful \n\nblow against Christian faith.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a7408700c5588b9ecd1ab4ec952fbd44803146a5","amp;dn":"The+Christian+Delusion%3AWhy+Faith+Fails%5BSir.Fun%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a7408700c5588b9ecd1ab4ec952fbd44803146a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,64,135,0,197,88,139,158,205,26,180,236,149,47,189,68,128,49,70,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
