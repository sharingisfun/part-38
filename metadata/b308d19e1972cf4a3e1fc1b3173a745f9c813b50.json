Although The Rembrandts write most of their own songs, this one was written by Michael Skloff and Allee Willis and was initially offered to They Might Be Giants and R.E.M.\n\n    The song topped the Billboard Hot 100 Airplay chart for eight weeks. When the single was finally released, it reached number three in the UK and reached number seventeen on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 as the flipside to &quot;This House is not a Home&quot;. It also reached #1 on the U.S. Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks chart.\n\n    Rarely heard on UK radio after its early popularity, the song was frequently played on UK pop radio in 2004 around the time of the series finale.\n\n    The song was also ranked at #15 on Blender magazine's list of the &quot;50 Worst Songs Ever&quot;.\n\n\n        The music video of this song was also popular worldwide, featuring all the six main stars of the show where they gradually take the singing and dancing roles of the band. The video was included as a bonus feature on several of the show's Complete Season DVD Boxsets.\n\n                        *** I'll Be There for You.***\n\n\n                                   Enjoy!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b308d19e1972cf4a3e1fc1b3173a745f9c813b50","amp;dn":"The+Rembrandts+-+I%5C%27ll+be+There+for+you%281995%29%28Full+%26+Clean%29-Wush","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b308d19e1972cf4a3e1fc1b3173a745f9c813b50","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,8,209,158,25,114,207,74,62,31,193,179,23,58,116,95,156,129,59,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
