He plays a variety of instruments, including the guitar, harmonica, keyboards, drums, and saxophone. Featuring his characteristic growl ? a unique mix of throaty folk, blues, Irish, scat, and Celtic influences ? Morrison is widely considered one of the most unusual and influential vocalists in the history of rock and roll. Critic Greil Marcus has gone so far as to say that &quot;no white man sings like Van Morrison.&quot;\n\nKnown as &quot;Van the Man&quot; by his fans, Morrison first rose to prominence as the lead singer of the Northern Irish band, Them, penning their seminal 1964 hit &quot;Gloria&quot;. A few years later, Morrison left the band for a successful solo career. The Best of Van Morrison is a compilation album by Northern Irish singer-songwriter Van Morrison, released in 1990 (see 1990 in music). This was his first ever &quot;Best of&quot; albums and was one of the best-selling albums of the 90s, spending a year and a half on the UK charts.[1]\n\nTrack listing\n\n&quot;Bright Side of the Road&quot; ? 3:45 \n&quot;Gloria&quot; ? 2:37 \n&quot;Moondance&quot; ? 4:31 \n&quot;Baby Please Don&amp;#039;t Go&quot; (Big Joe Williams) ? 3:03 \n&quot;Have I Told You Lately&quot; ? 4:18 \n&quot;Brown Eyed Girl&quot; ? 3:03 \n&quot;Sweet Thing&quot; ? 4:22 \n&quot;Warm Love&quot; ? 3:21 \n&quot;Wonderful Remark&quot; ? 3:58 \n&quot;Jackie Wilson Said (I&amp;#039;m In Heaven When You Smile)&quot; ? 2:57 \n&quot;Full Force Gale&quot; ? 3:12 \n&quot;And It Stoned Me&quot; ? 4:30 \n&quot;Here Comes the Night&quot; (Bert Berns) ? 2:46 \n&quot;Domino&quot; ? 3:08 \n&quot;Did Ye Get Healed&quot; ? 4:06 \n&quot;Wild Night&quot; ? 3:31 \n&quot;Cleaning Windows&quot; ? 4:42 \n&quot;Whenever God Shines His Light&quot; ? 4:54 \n&quot;Queen Of The Slipstream&quot; ? 4:53 \n&quot;Dweller On The Threshold&quot; (Hugh Murphy/Morrison) ? 4:47 \n\nThe 1998 Australian/New Zealand re-release of the album also includes &quot;Days Like This&quot; (3:13) as the seventh track, for a total of 21 tracks.\n\nReleased January 1990 \nRecorded 1964-1989 \nGenre Classic Rock \nLength 75:54 \nLabel Polydor Records \nProducer(s) Bert Berns, Van Morrison \n\nEnjoy! and please seed..\nEkolb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e899d3e6b4eab0f616cfd3e8d3d4ef9e9bd5785","amp;dn":"Van+Morrison+%28The+Best+Of%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e899d3e6b4eab0f616cfd3e8d3d4ef9e9bd5785","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,137,157,62,107,78,171,15,97,108,253,62,141,61,78,249,233,189,87,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
