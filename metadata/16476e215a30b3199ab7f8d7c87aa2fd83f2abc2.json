Beatrice Romand (the adolescent star of Rohmer's Claire's Knee, now nicely grown up) impulsively decides that Andre Dussolier-whom she barely knows--would make an ideal husband. Now she must convince him that she'll make an ideal wife. Leaving her old boy friend in the dust, Romand launches her single-purposed pursuit of Dussolier. But because she's jumped in and started swimming without first checking the waters, our headstrong heroine is in for a major disappointment. Even after she's down, however, Romand refuses to be counted out. \n\n   General\n      Complete name : Eric Rohmer - Le Beau Mariage (1982).avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      Format/Family : RIFF\n      File size : 1.37 GiB\n      PlayTime : 1h 34mn\n      Bit rate : 2071 Kbps\n      StreamSize : 8.72 MiB\n      Writing application : Nandub v1.0rc2\n      Writing library : Nandub build 1852/release\n   Video #0\n      Codec : XviD\n      Codec/Family : MPEG-4\n      Codec/Info : XviD project\n      Codec profile : Streaming Video Profile/Level 1\n      Codec settings/PacketBitStream : No\n      Codec settings/BVOP : No\n      Codec settings/QPel : No\n      Codec settings/GMC : 0\n      Codec settings/Matrix : Default\n      PlayTime : 1h 34mn\n      Bit rate : 1842 Kbps\n      Width : 640 pixels\n      Height : 480 pixels\n      Display Aspect ratio : 4/3\n      Frame rate : 25.000 fps\n      Resolution : 8 bits\n      Chroma : 4:2:0\n      Interlacement : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.239\n      StreamSize : 1.21 GiB\n   Audio #1\n      Codec : AC3\n      PlayTime : 1h 34mn\n      Bit rate : 222 Kbps\n      Bit rate mode : CBR\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Channel positions : L R\n      Sampling rate : 48 KHz\n      StreamSize : 150 MiB\n\nIMDB: tt0082053\n\nFrench audio, English, Spanish and Portuguese subtitles.
