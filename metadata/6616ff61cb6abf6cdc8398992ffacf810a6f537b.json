After being rescued, Wendy graciously brings him back to her town of Evergreen, where she treats him to lunch. It is explained that Evergreen is under siege by a gang called the Wild Bunch led by their boss, Lucky Roulette. Van declines to help, but Wendy persistently chases after him, even offering to be his bride. Lucky later attacks the town with his armor. Van finally summons his armor, Dann, after Wendy is threatened and Lucky attacks Van dishonorably Ã¢â‚¬â€œ from behind. After Van defeats Lucky Roulette, Van and Wendy confront Lucky on the whereabouts of Michael Garret, Wendy's brother. Lucky says he sold Michael to a man with a claw on his right hand a week past, but doesn't know where they are now. The next day, when Van leaves to continue his search for The Claw, Wendy informs him she is joining him because she intends to rescue her brother. Nothing Van can say will convince her otherwise. Whether he likes it or not (and he doesn't), he has a companion. \n\nInfo:\nAudio: Eng/Jap\nAubs: Eng\nEps: 26\nEncoder: Frozen_Solid [F-D]\nSize/ep: 80MB +/-\nFormat: .mkv\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6616ff61cb6abf6cdc8398992ffacf810a6f537b","amp;dn":"%5BF-D%5DGun+X+Sword+%5B480P%5D%5BDual-Audio%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6616ff61cb6abf6cdc8398992ffacf810a6f537b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,22,255,97,203,106,191,108,220,131,152,153,47,250,207,129,10,111,83,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
