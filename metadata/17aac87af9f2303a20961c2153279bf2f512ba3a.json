But on their first day, they encountered the Jyuukenbu, a martial arts group of the school. Members of the group, Maya Natsume, her sister Aya, and Masataka Takayanagi easily overpowered Souchirou and Bob. And what's more, due to what was assumed to be their &quot;connections&quot; with the Jyuukenbu, the two were attacked by members of the Enforcement Group, which oversees the martial arts groups of the school. Drawn into the personal conflicts between the Jyuukenbu and the Enforcement Group, Souchirou and Bob have no choice but to join up with Maya Natsume's group and to hone their skills to become even stronger.\n(source: AnimeNewsNetwork)\n\nBasically, lots of fighting, some nudity and a story that revolves around supernatural abilities.\n\nFILE INFORMATION\n\nScanlators:MangaTranslation,Evil_Genius\n\nComments:Everything is translated by MangaTranslation, except for chapter 75.
