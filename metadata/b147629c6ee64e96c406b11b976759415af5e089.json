Though perhaps borrowing slightly from Maxis' 1991 SimAnt in theme and setting, Empire of the Ants offers state-of-the-art real-time strategy gaming in a whole new arena. Players battle for control of 3D-rendered landscapes featuring enormous mushrooms and towering blades of grass. While seasoned real-time strategy gamers should recognize the conventional themes of resource management and military expansion, Empire of the Ants interprets these concepts on its own terms.\n\nHow to play:\n1) Burn Ants.cue to a disc or mount it on a virtual drive;\n2) Start Launch.exe to install the game (it will open automatically if you have autorun enabled);\n3) Run Patch_161.exe to patch the game;\n4) Play the game with the disc inserted.\n\n! Warning\nThe game gives many errors on Windows 7 and crashes after a short while. Use an older version of Windows to play the game normally.\n\nIf you like the game, SUPPORT the developers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b147629c6ee64e96c406b11b976759415af5e089","amp;dn":"Empire+of+the+Ants","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b147629c6ee64e96c406b11b976759415af5e089","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,71,98,156,110,230,78,150,196,6,177,27,151,103,89,65,90,245,224,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
