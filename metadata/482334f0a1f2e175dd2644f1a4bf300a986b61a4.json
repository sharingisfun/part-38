Redick.\nE-Book is fully formatted, working table of contents etc. in epub format.\n\nRating: 3.98/5\nPlot(From Goodreads): The mighty centuries old ship, Chathrand, is long gone...\n\nAt the centre of an infernal forest there is clearing. Above it looms a seven hundred foot tall fragment of a vast tower. At its base, a group of friends. Exhausted, terrified. They stand around the body of a sorcerer, Arunis. In his wizened hand lies the Nilstone.\n\nThe Nilstone. An ancient artifact that has unleashed the Night of the Swarm; an ever growing cloud of darkness that is, even now, racing across the world of Alifros, threatening annihilation to all.\n\nThe only thing that can banish the Swarm is to take the Nilstone out of this world. But to do this the friends, Pazel, Thasha, Neeps and the mage Ramachni, must make a perilous voyage down the River of Shadows to where it leaves the world. Only there, far from any hope of rescue, can the Nilstone be cast away.\n\nBut the Sorceress Macadra is hunting for the Nilstone as well. This is not the end..\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9329516-the-night-of-the-swarm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9329516-the-night-of-the-swarm&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:482334f0a1f2e175dd2644f1a4bf300a986b61a4","amp;dn":"The+Night+of+the+Swarm%2C+Robert+V.S.+Redick%2C+Book+3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"482334f0a1f2e175dd2644f1a4bf300a986b61a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,35,52,240,161,242,225,117,221,38,68,241,164,191,48,10,152,107,97,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
