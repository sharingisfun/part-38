Both seem hopelessly unobtainable until her college professor suggests that with a new angle, her paper could be published. Spring swears sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll do whatever it takes to ensure that happens.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Whatever it takes,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ however, means forming a partnership with the very hot, very privileged, very conceited Henry Knightly.\n\nHenry is Spring's only hope at publication, but he's also the ÃƒÂ¼ber-rich son of a land developer and cash-strapped SpringÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s polar opposite. Too bad she can't help being attracted to the way he pushes her buttons, both politically and physically. As they work on her thesis, Spring finds there's more to Henry than his old money and argyle sweatersÃ¢â‚¬Â¦but can she drop the loud-and-proud act long enough to let him in? Suddenly, choosing between what she wants and what she needs puts Spring at odds with everything she believes in.\n\nDefinitely, Maybe in Love is a modern take on Pride and Prejudice that proves true love is worth risking a little pride.\n================\n\nDovah","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd4fd10c51d5b257673d965dd3e73613c892e4ea","amp;dn":"Ophelia+London%2C+Definitely%2C+Maybe+in+Love+2013+%5Bdovah%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd4fd10c51d5b257673d965dd3e73613c892e4ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,79,209,12,81,213,178,87,103,61,150,93,211,231,54,19,200,146,228,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
