This is your guidebook. A time machine has just transported you back into the fourteenth century. What do you see? How do you dress? How do you earn a living and how much are you paid? What sort of food will you be offered by a peasant or a monk or a lord? And more important, where will you stay?\n\nThe Time TravelerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Guide to Medieval England is not your typical look at a historical period. This radical new approach shows us that the past is not just something to be studied; it is also something to be lived.\n\nThrough the use of daily chronicles, letters, household accounts, and poems of the day, Mortimer transports you back in time, providing answers to questions typically ignored by traditional historians. You will learn how to greet people on the street, what to use as toilet paper, why a physician might want to taste your blood, and how to know whether you are coming down with leprosy. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Time-Travelers-Guide-Medieval-England/dp/1439112908/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1334249009&amp;sr=8-3&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Time-Travelers-Guide-Medieval-England/dp/1439112908/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1334249009&amp;sr=8-3&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:444af89a164447e430a570668c5312b8c3f4c09d","amp;dn":"The+Time+Travelers+Guide+to+Medieval+England%3A+A+Handbook+for+Vis","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"444af89a164447e430a570668c5312b8c3f4c09d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,74,248,154,22,68,71,228,48,165,112,102,140,83,18,184,195,244,192,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
