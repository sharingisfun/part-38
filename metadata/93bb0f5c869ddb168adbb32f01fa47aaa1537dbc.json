He is pretty intent on just sitting in his chair, drinking beer, on the lawn. His cop friend, Frank Garcia, thinks he should at least pretend to have a yard sale to make it legal. He slowly starts making friends with a neighborhood kid who needs something to do, and a pregnant wife who has just moved in across the street, and Nick finds himself moving on and selling all his stuff.\n\n\n\nDetails\n\n\nDirector:Dan Rush\nWriters:Dan Rush, Raymond Carver (short story &quot;Why Don't You Dance&quot;)\nStars:Will Ferrell, Rebecca Hall and Christopher Jordan Wallace \nGenres:Comedy | Drama \nCountry:USA\nLanguage:English\nRelease Date:14 October 2011 (Ireland)\nAlso Known As:Alles muss raus\n\n\nRatings: 6.5/10\n\n\nBox Office\n\n\nBudget:$5,000,000 (estimated)\nOpening Weekend:$791,677 (USA) (15 May 2011) \nGross:$2,711,210 (USA) (11 September 2011) ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:93bb0f5c869ddb168adbb32f01fa47aaa1537dbc","amp;dn":"Everything.Must.Go.2010.BRRiP.XviD.AbSurdiTy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"93bb0f5c869ddb168adbb32f01fa47aaa1537dbc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,187,15,92,134,157,219,22,138,219,179,47,1,250,71,170,161,83,125,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
