After publishing, he felt that companies often committed yet another 8th offense: not enabling their people to rise to the top level of their talent. Instead, either companies employ too many people and donÃƒÂ¢??t have challenging work for all of them, or these companies bring in outsiders who fail to connect with the existing culture such as Fiorina and Fisher and Nardelli.\n\nAbout the author:\nLDr. Jagdish (Jag) N. Sheth is the Charles H. Kellstadt Professor of Marketing in the Goizueta Business School at Emory University. Professor Sheth is highly sought out as a keynote speaker at many industry, academic and public forums. Dr. Sheth is frequently quoted and interviewed by the Wall Street Journal, New York Times, Fortune, Financial Times, Economic Times and radio shows and television networks such as CNN , CNBC (India)and BBC. A prolific author, in 2000 Dr. Sheth and Andrew Sobel published a best seller, Clients for Life (Simon &amp; Schuster).
