The text is supported by a wealth of over 1200 illustrations of the highest quality: color photographs, radiographic and ultrasound images, and diagrams.\n\nThe book is system-based and each individual system is introduced with precise information on the relevant basic anatomy and physiology, standard clinical examination techniques and useful differential diagnostic aids. This is followed by diseases and disorders that are pertinent to that system, grouped together either anatomically or based on presenting clinical signs. Each condition is described using consistent headings: definition/overview, etiology and pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, differential diagnoses, management/treatment, and prognosis. Additional chapters deal with the foal, with wounds and behavioral problems.\n\nThe focus throughout is on providing clinically relevant information required for practical case management, plus sufficient background on causes and disease processes to enable readers to understand the conditions and the rationale for diagnostic and treatment options.\n\nThis book is of lasting value as a teaching and training resource for equine specialists, a ready reference for non-specialist practitioners, and a textbook for students in veterinary medicine and related equine courses.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:262f2bb1ff152be9df0fc5472ed7a446bd2642a0","amp;dn":"Equine_Clinical_Medicine%2C_Surgery_and_Reproduction_...%5BLeah1289%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"262f2bb1ff152be9df0fc5472ed7a446bd2642a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,47,43,177,255,21,43,233,223,15,197,71,46,215,164,70,189,38,66,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
