Crowley. After adding drummer John Friesen, Player signed to impresario Robert Stigwood's RSO label and issued &quot;Baby Come Back,&quot; which sat atop the pop singles chart for three weeks in early 1978; their self-titled debut LP appeared that same year, as did the follow-up, Danger Zone. Crowley exited Player soon after, later enjoying a solo career as a country artist; the remaining trio issued Room with a View in 1980 before Moss and Friesen both departed as well. Beckett, the lone remaining founding member, continued the group for one final LP, 1982's Spies of Life, before retiring the Player name to mount a career as a songwriter and solo performer. Moss, meanwhile, joined the cast of the daytime soap opera The Bold and the Beautiful in 1987; he and Beckett re-formed Player in 1995, soon thereafter issuing the reunion LP Lost in Reality. \n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tFLAC (Lossless)\nAudiochecker:\t     \t99.80% CDDA\nLabel:\t\t\tMercury\nCatalog:\t\t848 015-2\n\n\n\n\n\nAudio Info:\n\n\n01.Baby Come Back\n02.Givin' It All\n03.I Just Wanna Be With You\n04.Let Me Down Easy\n05.I've Been Thinkin'\n06.Tryin' To Write A Hit Song\n07.This Time I'm In It For Love\n08.It's For You\n09.Bad News Travels Fast\n10.Who Do You Think You Are\n11.Upside Down Again\n12.Prisoner Of Your Love\n13.Wait Until Tomorrow\n14.Every Which Way\n15.Silver Lining\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for Seeding\nEnjoy...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a3067c993f3e7f3c145b94824da85d0a72ad13fc","amp;dn":"Player+-+Best+Of+Player+%281990%29+%7BFLAC%7D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a3067c993f3e7f3c145b94824da85d0a72ad13fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,6,124,153,63,62,127,60,20,91,148,130,77,168,93,10,114,173,19,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
