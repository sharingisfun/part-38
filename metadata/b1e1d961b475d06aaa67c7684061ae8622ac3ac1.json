We put out one every two weeks for about 3 months.  They are all out of print, but are compiled on a bonus disc that comes with the physical copy of New Best Friends.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1e1d961b475d06aaa67c7684061ae8622ac3ac1","amp;dn":"Mansions+-+The+EP+Initiative+%28320%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1e1d961b475d06aaa67c7684061ae8622ac3ac1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,225,217,97,180,117,208,106,170,103,199,104,64,97,174,134,34,172,58,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
