It tells the stories of six survivors of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima, covering a period of time immediately prior to and one year after the atomic bomb was dropped on August 6, 1945. It was originally published in The New Yorker. Although the story was originally scheduled to be published over four issues, the entire August 31, 1946 edition was dedicated to the article. The article and subsequent book are regarded as one of the earliest examples of the New Journalism, in which the story-telling techniques of fiction are adapted to non-fiction reporting.\n\nFormats: ePub and mobi.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:051e576849eb6642ce2edba73cb9d7eb2961bb5d","amp;dn":"Hiroshima+-+John+Hersey+%28epub+and+mobi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"051e576849eb6642ce2edba73cb9d7eb2961bb5d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,30,87,104,73,235,102,66,206,46,219,167,60,185,215,235,41,97,187,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
