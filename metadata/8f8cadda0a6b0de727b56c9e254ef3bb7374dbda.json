The band have since experienced multiple line-up changes, with guitarist Iommi being the only constant presence in the band through the years. Originally formed in 1968 as a blues rock band, the group soon adopted the Black Sabbath moniker and began incorporating occult themes with horror-inspired lyrics and tuned-down guitars. Despite an association with these two themes, Black Sabbath also composed songs dealing with social instability, political corruption, the dangers of drug abuse and apocalyptic prophecies of the horrors of war.\n\nOsbourne's regular abuse of drugs and alcohol led to his dismissal from the band in 1979. He was replaced by former Rainbow vocalist Ronnie James Dio. Following two albums with Dio, Black Sabbath endured countless personnel changes in the 1980s and 1990s that included vocalists Ian Gillan, Glenn Hughes, Ray Gillen and Tony Martin, as well as several drummers and bassists. In 1992, Iommi and Butler rejoined Dio and drummer Vinny Appice to record Dehumanizer. The original line-up reunited with Osbourne in 1997 and released a live album Reunion. Black Sabbath's 19th studio album, 13, which features all of the original members but Ward, was released in June 2013.\n\nBlack Sabbath are often cited as pioneers of heavy metal music. The band helped define the genre with releases such as Black Sabbath (1970), Paranoid (1970) and Master of Reality (1971). They were ranked by MTV as the &quot;Greatest Metal Band&quot; of all time, and placed second in VH1's &quot;100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock&quot; list. Rolling Stone magazine ranked them number 85 in their &quot;100 Greatest Artists of All Time&quot;. They have sold over 70 million records worldwide. Black Sabbath were inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005 and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2006. They have also won two Grammy Awards for Best Metal Performance.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSeventh Star is the twelfth studio album by British band Black Sabbath, released in January 1986. The release came at a difficult time as the group had just finished a highly contentious tour, experiencing conflicts within the band. With guitarist and songwriter Tony Iommi being the sole original member left, musicians Geoff Nicholls, Eric Singer, and Dave Spitz contributed to the album, playing keyboards, drums, and bass, respectively. Musically, it features a blues rock influenced sound that moved from the group's traditional heavy metal to a more eclectic style.\n\nThe album was the group's first release without bassist Geezer Butler, who left the band in 1984 after the aforementioned Born Again tour. It was originally written, recorded, and intended to be the first solo album by Iommi, as shown by the musical experimentation. However, due to pressures by Warner Bros. Records and the prompting of band manager Don Arden, the record was billed as Black Sabbath featuring Tony Iommi. Glenn Hughes, ex-Deep Purple bassist and vocalist, was lead singer but did not play bass on this release.\n\nLater releases label the album as simply by Black Sabbath. Despite the issues behind the release's production, it earned major commercial success, reaching #78 on the Billboard 200 chart.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBlack Sabbath:\n\n\nTony Iommi: guitar\nGeoff Nicholls: keyboards\nGlenn Hughes: vocals\nDave Spitz: bass guitar\nEric Singer: drums\n\n\nAdditional:\n\nGordon Copley: bass guitar (on &quot;No Stranger to Love&quot;)\nRay Gillen: vocals (on &quot;2010 Deluxe Edition Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Disc 2&quot;)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f8cadda0a6b0de727b56c9e254ef3bb7374dbda","amp;dn":"Black+Sabbath+-+Seventh+Star+%5B2CD%5D%5B1986%5D%5B2010%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D%5BDE%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f8cadda0a6b0de727b56c9e254ef3bb7374dbda","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,140,173,218,10,107,13,231,39,181,108,158,37,78,243,187,115,116,219,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
