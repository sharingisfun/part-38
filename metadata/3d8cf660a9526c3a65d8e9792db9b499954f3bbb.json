Can the Bible's puzzling, often baffling and contradictory stories of the Apostles, riddled with high stakes mysteries, magic and malevolence ultimately be understood through modern investigation? Deadly Journeys of the Apostles explores the ultimate hero's journeys. New support from historical records, archeology, Apocrypha (historic stories and writing outside the Biblical Canon) and modern investigation expands on the traditional biblical accounts of the Apostles. This series explores fresh evidence of the Apostles' incredible travels.\n\n\n1)  From the Holy Land to Africa \nIn the aftermath of the world's most famous crucifixion, Jesus' 12 Apostles are charged with delivering his message to the four corners of the earth. Through scripture, myth, legend and folklore, these journeys to the north, south, east and west are reimagined. Walk with Philip, Simon and Matthew as they embark south.\n\n2)  Jerusalem to the North \nThough their stories cannot be found in the Bible, legends claim that Apostles Jude, John and James the Less embarked north, and their martyrdom enshrines them in history. Join us as we look at myth and folklore, exploring the scope of these fabled journeys.\n\n3)  Messengers to the West \nThe Bible's book of Acts recounts the Apostle Andrew's presence at Pentecost, and Peter as the leader of the nascent Christian faith. But biblical accounts of their journeys stop there. Go further with us as we explore ancient apocryphal texts and medieval legends, which claim that James the Great traveled to the shores of the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n4)  Travellers to the East \nAfter Jesus' crucifixion, three Apostles - Bartholomew, Matthias and Thomas - supposedly embark on dangerous missions to the east. Examine their stories as we search through folklore to find out about these incredible journeys.\n\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;eca4858b84aca0d8c2dd&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script data-cfhash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;data-cfhash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}t.parentNode.removeChild(t);}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n * Video Bitrate: 3051 Kbps\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.778 (16:9)\n * Video Resolution: 1280 x 720\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\n * Audio English\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\n * Run-Time: 44mins\n * Framerate: 23.976 fps\n * Number of Parts: 4\n * Container Mp4\n * Part Size: 1,009 MB\n * Source: HDTV\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\nRelease Notes\nMerged Subtitles\nOnly for parts 1,3 and 4 , sorry no subs for part 2","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d8cf660a9526c3a65d8e9792db9b499954f3bbb","amp;dn":"Deadly.Journeys.of.the.Apostles.3of4.Messengers.to.the.West.720p","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d8cf660a9526c3a65d8e9792db9b499954f3bbb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,140,246,96,169,82,108,58,101,216,233,121,45,185,180,153,149,79,59,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
