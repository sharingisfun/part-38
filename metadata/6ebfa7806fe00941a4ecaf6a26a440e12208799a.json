(2000)\n\nBYO Records\n\n\nLive! features the Cadillac Tramps performing a selection of the best material from all 3 of their out-of-print albums. Live does an excellent job of summing up the first part of the band's career. Fast, hard, tight rock 'n' roll like Mother used to make. Your parole officer probably won't like it.\n\nRecorded at The Galaxy Theater, Santa Ana, California.\n\n\nThe Cadillac Tramps are: \n\nMike &quot;Gabby&quot; Gaborno (vocals); Brian Coakley, Mike &quot;Maddog&quot; Combs (guitar); Warren Renfro (bass); Steven &quot;Spanky&quot; Barrios (drums).\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n1.Intro\n2.Hoodoo Guru\n3.Don't Ya Know\n4.Should I\n5.Life On The Edge\n6.Bridges\n7.Barbed Wire\n8.Medicine Man\n9.Cadillac Hearse\n10.Move To The Hills\n11.Shake\n12.Drivin' Intro\n13.Drivin'\n14.Alright\n15.Hate\n16.Train To Fame","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ebfa7806fe00941a4ecaf6a26a440e12208799a","amp;dn":"Cadillac+Tramps+-+Live%21+%282000%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ebfa7806fe00941a4ecaf6a26a440e12208799a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,191,167,128,111,224,9,65,164,236,175,106,38,164,64,225,34,8,121,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
