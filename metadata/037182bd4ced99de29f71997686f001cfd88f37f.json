Sadly many of the\nmasters have long since disappeared so the source footage has been restored\nto the best quality possible.  It is as good as we are ever likely to\nhave... but what footage it is!  Included on the collectors only disc is\nthe film which was shown at Wembley before the &quot;High and Mighty&quot; shows,\nrare interviews from US and Australian television networks, previously\nunreleased footage from an unaired US television show shot in 1972, the\nbest of the Japanese Budokan shows from March '73, film from one of Byron's\nlast gigs in Europe and all of the surviving promotional film of  Rough\nDiamond.  How about that for a mouth-watering prospect?\n\nFULL TRACK LISTING DISC 2 - COLLECTORS RARITIES *\n- Uriah Heep - High and Mighty Intro '76\n- Uriah Heep - Midnight '76\n- Uriah Heep - Guitar improvisation '76\n- Uriah Heep - Sweet Lorraine '76\n- Uriah Heep - Band TV Interview USA '72\n- Uriah Heep - July Morning '72 (USA)\n- Uriah Heep - Look at Yourself '73 (Japan)\n- Uriah Heep - Sunrise '73 (Japan)\n- Uriah Heep - Traveller in time '73 (Japan)\n- Uriah Heep - Tears in my Eyes '73 (Japan)\n- Uriah Heep - Australian Box/Byron Interview '73\n- Uriah Heep - Easy Livin' '72 (USA)\n- Uriah Heep - Rock'n'Roll Medley '72 (Japan)\n\nBonus Tracks\n- Uriah Heep - July Morning Montage (Europe/Japan - '73/'76)\n- Rough Diamond -  Rock'n'Roll '77\n- Rough Diamond -  Looking For You '77\n- Rough Diamond - Seasong '77\n- Rough Diamond - Scared '77\n- Rough Diamond -  Lock'n'Key '77\n\n\nEnjoy the show, and don't be shy about leaving comments!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:037182bd4ced99de29f71997686f001cfd88f37f","amp;dn":"Uriah+Heep+-+Classic+Heep+Live+From+The+Byron+Era+%5BDisc+2%5D+-+cOO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"037182bd4ced99de29f71997686f001cfd88f37f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,113,130,189,76,237,153,222,41,247,25,151,104,111,0,28,253,136,243,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
