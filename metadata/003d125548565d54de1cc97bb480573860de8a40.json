The four tracks from their first release, an independently released 1963 EP featuring primitive R&amp;B standards, are small but noteworthy bonus cuts that close this collection. \n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img690.imageshack.us/img690/7686/folderhqu.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img690.imageshack.us/img690/7686/folderhqu.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n01.
