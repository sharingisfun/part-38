The aim of the treaties was to make wars more civilised. Did they succeed? The first treaty ever about the waging of wars was signed in 1964. The 'Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field' is what it dealt with. The treaty also contained rules about the treatment of the death. The initiative came from the Swiss founder of the Red Cross, Henri Durant.\nIn the decades that followed and as the 'art' of warfare further developed (technologically in the first place) this first treaty was adapted and refined - or completely new treaties were signed. About aerial bombardments for instance - first from balloons and then from airplanes. About landmines. About mustard gas and other chemical weapons. About the protection of citizens and the concept of genocide. The question arose: what about civil wars? What about resistance or guerrilla fighters? What about the uniformed personnel used by some armies today at their army barracks - personnel that officially is no part of the armed forces? What rules should govern wars against terrorists?\nOver a hundred treaties about the waging of war exist today. The most recent one was signed in 2005. But the four Geneva Conventions signed in 1949 remained - not in the least symbolically - the most important ones.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img202.imageshack.us/img202/5066/tzdq.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img202.imageshack.us/img202/5066/tzdq.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img833.imageshack.us/img833/1251/dx4r.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img833.imageshack.us/img833/1251/dx4r.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img189.imageshack.us/img189/2450/mn6w.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img189.imageshack.us/img189/2450/mn6w.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img15.imageshack.us/img15/9986/qu0q.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img15.imageshack.us/img15/9986/qu0q.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img163.imageshack.us/img163/7189/vo0v.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img163.imageshack.us/img163/7189/vo0v.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img710.imageshack.us/img710/1814/zwcc.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img710.imageshack.us/img710/1814/zwcc.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\nVideo Codec: x264 ,AVC-1\nVideo Bitrate: CRF 20\nVideo Resolution: 1280x720\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 16:9\nAudio Codec: AC3\nAudio BitRate: 384 kbps\nAudio Streams: 2.0\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime Per Part: 78 min\nNumber Of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 2.09 GB\nRipped by Hukumuzuku\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Related Documentaries &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Our%20War%20-%2010%20Years%20in%20Afghanistan&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Our%20War%20-%2010%20Years%20in%20Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=The%20Battle%20for%20Syria&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=The%20Battle%20for%20Syria&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Cuba%20Africa%20Revolution&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Cuba%20Africa%20Revolution&lt;/a&gt;\n\n2)  ed2k Links \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdded by &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=User%3Ahukumuzuku&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=User%3Ahukumuzuku&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSource: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/index.php?title=War_Is_Not_a_Game&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/index.php?title=War_Is_Not_a_Game&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ef2432e7f497878e68c81b5c3e71dec3fc861d2","amp;dn":"Arte+War+Is+Not+A+Game+x264+720p+AC3+HDTV+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ef2432e7f497878e68c81b5c3e71dec3fc861d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,242,67,46,127,73,120,120,230,140,129,181,195,231,29,236,63,200,97,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
