The group's second effort, Pool Party, released just a year later, is a whole other matter. Produced by Dave Fridmann of Flaming Lips and Mercury Rev fame, Pool Party is full of echoing vocals, muted guitars, backwards guitars, dreamy keyboards, neo-psychedelic touches and an air of care and importance that puts them a lot closer on this outing to a dollar store version of the Flaming Lips than it does the Blasters, say, and it is such a pronounced change of direction, it should almost be looked at as a different band, or a second debut album.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f11b0b3a79fe959adb920686b580a93b1aebf69","amp;dn":"Ponderosa+-+Pool+Party+%282012%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f11b0b3a79fe959adb920686b580a93b1aebf69","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,17,176,179,167,159,233,89,173,185,32,104,107,88,10,147,177,174,191,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
