This is widely known as 'Ian Levine's Shada.'\n\nFrom A Fan:\n\nThis is what IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve done.\n\nBasically, this is IanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Shada Ã¢â‚¬â€œ but has been re-mastered to replace the VHS footage with DVD footage.\n\nIt has also been re-edited to flow better and to make its running time to similar to a standard BBC running time. This involved the loss of a lot of padding and general tightening up of the original version. (The original was nearly 20 minutes longer).  [Uploader's note: A Fan is referring to losing the padding in the animated scenes.]\n\nIt has also had foley work done to add in sound effects and the like that had been left of from LevineÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s original.\n\nI just want the fans to see and be able to have what he wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t give.\n\n*         *       *         *       *       *       *         *       *              \n\nThis is an m4v file.  A DVD9 will be uploaded shortly.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c08558d3d42bc0c82aa081033d35d0fe4b251d0c","amp;dn":"Doctor+Who+-+Shada+Ian+Levine","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c08558d3d42bc0c82aa081033d35d0fe4b251d0c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,133,88,211,212,43,192,200,42,160,129,3,61,53,208,254,75,37,29,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
