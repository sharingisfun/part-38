His wealth of hooky melodies and thoughtful acoustic musings has been spread out over five strong releases and his almost John Denver-like aura of sincerity gives him an approachable allure. On Por Favor, the singerâ€™s sixth effort, he strips his music down to the barest essentials to create what is easily his most vulnerable and intimate album. Admittedly worn thin by a relationship on the rocks, family trouble, and a health scare, this is a Dennen weâ€™ve never heard, with a noticeably frayed spirit and a searching heart. The feeling of heightened sensitivity and the minimalist production from Nashvilleâ€™s Dave Cobb (Sturgill Simpson, Jason Isbell) gives Por Favor more of an organic and timeless feeling than any of Dennenâ€™s prior work, and his quavering high tenor has never sounded so appropriate to the material. But even in his darkest hours, Dennenâ€™s breezy style and humble demeanor make him come off like a fallen optimist trying to retune his antenna sunward. Light tones of calypso and reggae color tracks like â€œWhatâ€™s the Secret?â€ and â€œStand Up for It,â€ and the rhythm section of drummer Chris Powell and bassist Brian Allen pepper the tunes with a roomy, off-the-cuff vibe. On his sunnier moments, Dennen evokes the loose, rootsy vibe of American Beauty-era Grateful Dead, and thereâ€™s even a reference to Jerry Garcia on the hushed standout â€œStrawberry Road.â€ Recorded in just a couple of weeks at Cobbâ€™s all-analog Nashville studio, the performances are loose and honest, with tape hiss filling the gaps between chords on quieter tunes like â€œWhere We Left Offâ€ and the bittersweet closer â€œIâ€™ll Be on Your Side.â€ As both a writer and a singer, Dennen has never sounded so fragile and unpolished and itâ€™s a perfect fit for this fantastic group of songs.\r\n\r\nTracklist:\r\n01_Whats_The_Secret.flac\r\n02_Cassidy.flac\r\n03_Stand_Up_For_It.flac\r\n04_Bonfire.flac\r\n05_Strawberry_Road.flac\r\n06_Another_Life.flac\r\n07_Where_We_Left_Off.flac\r\n08_Spirit.flac\r\n09_Tengboche.flac\r\n10_Ill_Be_On_Your_Side.flac\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nCountry: USA\r\nGenre: Indie-Folk\r\n\r\n\r\nMedia Report:\r\nSource : CD\r\nFormat : FLAC\r\nFormat/Info : Free Lossless Audio Codec, 16-bit PCM\r\nBit rate mode : Variable\r\nBit rate : ~646-926 Kbps\r\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\r\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\r\nBit depth : 16 bits","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c11510e18f500f3fabb702789625ff8bdbd89ab7","amp;dn":"%282016%29+Brett+Dennen+-+Por+Favor+%5BFLAC%2CTracks%5D+%7B100.XY%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c11510e18f500f3fabb702789625ff8bdbd89ab7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,21,16,225,143,80,15,63,171,183,2,120,150,37,255,139,219,216,154,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
