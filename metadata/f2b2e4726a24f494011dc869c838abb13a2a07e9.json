Her third-place finish in the 2007 season of Canadian Idol resulted in a recording contract with Fontana and Maple music, as well as a spot on the requisite Top Three concert tour, and by 2008 the young singer/songwriter had released her debut LP, Tug of War, which featured the single &quot;Sunshine on My Shoulders,&quot; a cover of John Denver's 1974 hit ballad. Three years later, Jepsen released the single &quot;Call Me Maybe,&quot; which drew from dance-pop and disco and attained worldwide commercial success. The Curiosity EP, her second major release, followed in early 2012. Also in 2012, Jepsen released her second full-length album, Kiss, featuring duets with both Owl City and Justin Bieber. \n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tFLAC Lossless\nLabel:\t\t\tInterscope\nCatalog:\t\t0602537153589\nAudiochecker:\t\t99.72% CDDA\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n01.Tiny Little Bows\n02.This Kiss\n03.Call Me Maybe\n04.Curiosity\n05.Good Time (With Owl City)\n06.More Than A Memory\n07.Turn Me Up\n08.Hurt So Good\n09.Beautiful (With Justin Bieber)\n10.Tonight I'm Getting Over You\n11.Guitar String/Wedding Ring\n12.Your Heart Is A Muscle\n13.Drive\n14.Wrong Feels So Right\n15.Sweetie\n16.I Know You Have A Girlfriend (Bonus Track)\n17.Almost Said It (Bonus Track)\n18.Melt With You (Bonus Track)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            ****Thanks For Seeding!****\n                                     \n                                   ***Enjoy!***\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f2b2e4726a24f494011dc869c838abb13a2a07e9","amp;dn":"Carly+Rae+Jepsen+-+Kiss+%5BDeluxe%5D+%282012%29+%5BFLAC%5D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f2b2e4726a24f494011dc869c838abb13a2a07e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,178,228,114,106,36,244,148,1,29,200,105,200,56,171,177,58,42,7,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
