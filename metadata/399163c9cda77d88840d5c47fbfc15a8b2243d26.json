It's beautiful, and it doesn't need a translation because it's wordless. This volume is about the life of a pride of lions on the African plains. I'm assuming that's what the first two volumes are about as well. Highly recommended for those who enjoy a good wordless comic book (or in this case, a great one).\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nLove - Der Lowe\n\nAnkama, 2012, 87 pages\n\nWritten and Illustrated by Frederic Brremaud, Frederico Bertolucci","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:399163c9cda77d88840d5c47fbfc15a8b2243d26","amp;dn":"Love+03+Der+L%26ouml%3Bwe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"399163c9cda77d88840d5c47fbfc15a8b2243d26","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,145,99,201,205,167,125,136,132,13,92,71,251,252,21,168,178,36,61,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
