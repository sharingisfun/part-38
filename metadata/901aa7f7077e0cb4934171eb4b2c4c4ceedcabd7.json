From the banking scandal headlines, they look at Greek woes, suckling bankers and Blythe Masters' immaculately conceived Credit Default Swap. \n\nThey also discuss the circle of Hell that former prosecutor, William K. Black suggests is just punishment for Septic Tank Scum banksters and the bizarre view that President Obama has from 40,000 feet.       \n\n\n\nThe .mp3 in the torrent is audio extracted from the Russia Today video.
