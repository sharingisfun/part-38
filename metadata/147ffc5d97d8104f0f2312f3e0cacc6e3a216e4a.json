Bizzy's problems have continually permeated his dramatic solo records, which paint peculiar pictures that walk the tightrope between the beautiful and the horrific.On his third (released) record, ALPHA AND OMEGA, the Cleveland, OH performer observes how he &quot;made it rapping about crack&quot; and how he reads &quot;many books to elevate [his] mind.&quot; These two statements represent Bizzy Bone remarkably well; he's a rapper full of contradictions. Bizzy dubbed his entourage &quot;the 7th Sign Regime,&quot; an appellation that captures the apocalyptic feel of this record. ALPHA AND OMEGA conjures up a misty city alleyway full of dark corners and shadows, with Bizzy Bone hovering over the dead end--part-devil, part-angel, rapping (at times, nearly in tongues) over slow, sinister, creeping melodies.\n\nFor Newer Users.\nSimply Drag download folder to your Media Player.\n\n\nVideo\nID : 224 (0xE0)\nFormat : MPEG Video\nDuration : 33ms\nBit rate mode : Variable\nBit rate : 273 Kbps\nMaximum bit rate : 8 000 Kbps\nWidth : 720 pixels\nHeight : 480 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 4:3\nFrame rate : 29.970 fps\nStandard : NTSC\nBit depth : 8 bits\nScan type : Progressive\nScan order : Top Field First\nCompression mode : Lossy\n\nAudio\nFormat : AC-3\nFormat/Info : Audio Coding 3\nMuxing mode : DVD-Video\nDuration : 1mn 0s\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 192 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nChannel positions : Front: L R\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\nBit depth : 16 bits\nCompression mode : Lossy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:147ffc5d97d8104f0f2312f3e0cacc6e3a216e4a","amp;dn":"Bizzy+Bone+Alpha+%26amp%3B+Omega+2004+FLAC-Cue+%2B+Bonus+DVD+%28RLG%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"147ffc5d97d8104f0f2312f3e0cacc6e3a216e4a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,127,252,93,151,216,16,79,15,35,18,243,224,202,204,110,58,33,110,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
