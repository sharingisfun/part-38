Use lilyPad within the emulator to set up your controller or keyboard configuration.\n\nScanned with Comodo IS, compressed with 7zip, output size 1.77 gig. \n\nThis is PS2 [PAL] version.\n\n                                                                    \n                                     ENJOY.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e41ed02fd488922c0f96fb53d9493f27e429a4bd","amp;dn":"MX+Super+Fly+PS2+%2B+Emulator+for+PC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e41ed02fd488922c0f96fb53d9493f27e429a4bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,30,208,47,212,136,146,44,15,150,251,83,217,73,63,39,228,41,164,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
