Nattramn is a familiar face (or in some photos, the lack thereof) in the realm of black metal, having now notoriously fronted the Swedish project Silencer for only one album in Ã¢â‚¬Å“Death Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Pierce meÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.  The mythology surrounding the figure has it that he was institutionalized which led to the departure of Silencer all together as the sole other members, Leere, joined Shining for a short time.  Much past this point is unknown other than Nattramn re-emerged with a death industrial / dark ambient project by the name of Diagnose: Lebensgefahr in 2007, releasing Ã¢â‚¬â€ again Ã¢â‚¬â€ one album entitled Ã¢â‚¬Å“TransformalinÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ through Ominous Recordings and then Autopsy Kitchen Records before falling back into the distant shadows.  His silence was disturbingly familiar, however, this time it only took four years before he once again re-emerged, this time abandoning music all together in favor of art in the visual and literary form through poetry and frantic, sometimes seemingly automatic writing that describes a mind every bit as torn as the famous photographs and mythology that surround him","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0599b1d2f1807df2d6aac3cb257a0e1d0178a945","amp;dn":"Nattramn+-+Grishj%26auml%3Brta+%28Pig%27s+Heart%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0599b1d2f1807df2d6aac3cb257a0e1d0178a945","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,153,177,210,241,128,125,242,214,170,195,203,37,122,14,29,1,120,169,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
