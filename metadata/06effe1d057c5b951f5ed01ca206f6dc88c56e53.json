Marion Cotillard portrays Piaf, the superstar once raised as a young girl by her grandmother in a Normandy bordello, then discovered on a French street corner ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ as a complete unknown ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ by cabaret proprietor Louis LeplÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©e (GÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©rard Depardieu). The film segues breezily between various episodes from Piaf&amp;#039;s life ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ such as her lover, French boxer Marcel Cerdan&amp;#039;s (Jean-Pierre Martins) championship bout in mid-&amp;#039;40s New York; her period in Hollywood during the &amp;#039;50s; Piaf&amp;#039;s abandonment as a young girl by her contortionist father (and earlier by her mother, a street singer); her brushes with the law as an adult; and her 1951 car accident and subsequent morphine addiction that caused her to age well beyond her years and left her barely mobile; and, through it all, her ability (like Billie Holiday) to funnel personal tragedy and emotional struggles into her vocalizations ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ dazzling audiences in the process.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:06effe1d057c5b951f5ed01ca206f6dc88c56e53","amp;dn":"La+Vie+en+Rose+-+Edith+Pief+-+Full+DVD+rip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"06effe1d057c5b951f5ed01ca206f6dc88c56e53","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,239,254,29,5,124,91,149,31,94,208,28,162,6,246,220,136,197,110,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
