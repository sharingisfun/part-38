It was an immediate success in America and England, and was MelvilleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most popular work during his lifetime. It was not until the end of the 1930Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s that it was surpassed in popularity by Moby Dick, more than thirty years after his death. The story provoked harsh criticism for its condemnation of missionary efforts in the Pacific Islands. Many sought to discredit the book, claiming that it was a work of fiction, but this criticism ended when the events it described were corroborated by MelvilleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fellow castaway, Richard T. Greene, who appears in the story as the character Toby.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:72ca7c0a01d6d80ab3547acdec886dbf4cbe856d","amp;dn":"Typee+by+Herman+Melville+%5BrepublicV%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"72ca7c0a01d6d80ab3547acdec886dbf4cbe856d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,202,124,10,1,214,216,10,179,84,122,205,236,136,109,191,76,190,133,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
