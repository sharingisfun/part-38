This is an immensely dynamic and spiritual trio that sound as\nif they were meant to play together. Longtime legend Sunny Murray is considered\nto be the godfather of &quot;free-jazz&quot; drums having worked with Albert Ayler and\nCecil Taylor in the mid-sixties and then forming his own series of bands\nafterwards, often known as the Untouchable Factor. Two decades later, tenor sax\ngreat Louis Belogenis organized a group called Prima Materia with the amazing\ndrummer Rashied Ali to play the music of John Coltrane &amp; Albert Ayler. Sunny\nMurray, who has been living in France for many years selected Louie to play\nlive and record with for a disc called 'Perles Noires Vol I' for the Eremite\nlabel a few years back. So Mr. Belogenis returned the favor and asked Sunny\nMurray to record a trio date in a great studio in NYC and the results are just\nincredible.\n\n'Tiresias' was was a blind prophet of Thebes in Greek mythology, famous for his\nclairvoyance. In a way, naming this disc after after Tiresias does make sense\nsince this trio harks back to the birth of free jazz as well as into the\npresent and future with this spirit music that is rather elusive to pin\ndown. Choosing Michael Bisio for the bass chair is/was also a great idea since\nhe is one of the most creative and trustworthy bassists around. The trio starts\nwith a dreamy, slow-burning fury that builds through waves. Eerie bowed bass,\nsimmering drums &amp; cymbals and Ayler-esque note-bending and crying through the\nsax are at the center of this somber storm. All but one of the pieces was\nspontaneously composed with just one cover of John Coltrane's &quot;Alabama&quot;. During\nthe lengthy title piece Bisio plays a waltz-like groove while the sax and drums\nswirl around one another with an elegant grace. Sunny's unaccompanied drums\nsolo ascends from a humble rumble stretching into a sleepy solo from Louie\nslowly reaching for a calm conclusion. Trane's classic &quot;Alabama&quot; is a lovely,\ndelicate and tastefully captured with Bisio's touching bowed bass in perfect\ntandem with Louie's peaceful tenor. &quot;Seven Lives&quot; is an upliftng conclusion of\nstrong slow-burning intensity. Occasionally sublime, consistently superb and\nultimately filled with those warm, fleeting free spirits.\n\n--\n\nBy Stef &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.freejazzblog.org/2011/05/louie-belogenis-trio-tiresias-porter.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.freejazzblog.org/2011/05/louie-belogenis-trio-tiresias-porter.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBy Tim Niland\n\nBy Glenn Astarita &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://jazztimes.com/community/articles/27843-tiresias-the-louie-belogenis-trio-with-sunny-murray-michael-bisio&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://jazztimes.com/community/articles/27843-tiresias-the-louie-belogenis-trio-with-sunny-murray-michael-bisio&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBy Vittorio (it) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.musiczoom.it/?p=7372&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.musiczoom.it/?p=7372&lt;/a&gt;\n\nGuillaume Belhomme (fr) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://grisli.canalblog.com/archives/2011/07/25/21673823.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://grisli.canalblog.com/archives/2011/07/25/21673823.html&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f40241b8ffecf7bc922096027fc185607ffaf02","amp;dn":"The+Louie+Belogenis+Trio+-+Tiresias+%282011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f40241b8ffecf7bc922096027fc185607ffaf02","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,64,36,27,143,254,207,123,201,34,9,96,39,252,24,86,7,255,175,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
