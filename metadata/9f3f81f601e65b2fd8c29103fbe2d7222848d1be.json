Not five unelected people on the Supreme Court.\n And the federal government has a right in my mind to define what marriage is.\n Just like every state has a right to determine and define what marriage is.\n That these are not decisions that were to be implemented by the court.\n TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re to be handled by the collective will of the American public, \n thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s how our republic functions.\n And, when the Supreme Court steps in and says \n  Ã¢â‚¬ËœNo, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re the ones who know best how to decide these things,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ \n    I think itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a real problematic issue in our society.\n     And whether youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re on the left or on the right, \n      the idea that a court should have the power to take this power away and freedom away\n       from the American pubic to make these decisions to me is very, very disconcerting.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f3f81f601e65b2fd8c29103fbe2d7222848d1be","amp;dn":"The+Andrea+Tantaros+Radio+Show+JUN-26-2013+WED","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f3f81f601e65b2fd8c29103fbe2d7222848d1be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,63,129,246,1,230,91,47,216,194,145,3,251,226,215,34,40,72,209,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
