The play, set in Denmark, recounts how Prince Hamlet exacts revenge on his uncle Claudius, who has murdered Hamlet's father, the King, and then taken the throne and married Gertrude, Hamlet's mother. The play vividly charts the course of real and feigned madnessÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½from overwhelming grief to seething rageÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and explores themes of treachery, revenge, incest, and moral corruption.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f1d44729a313f6080be2713445e5fbf847c50c44","amp;dn":"HAMLET+-+William+Shakespeare.+Read+by+Frank+Muller+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f1d44729a313f6080be2713445e5fbf847c50c44","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,212,71,41,163,19,246,8,11,226,113,52,69,229,251,248,71,197,12,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
