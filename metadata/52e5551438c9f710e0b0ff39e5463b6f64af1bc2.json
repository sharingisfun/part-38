ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a 9 percent increase from the previous year, according to a new Equilar pay study for The New York Times.\nWhat the 1% DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Want You to Know-Moyers041614\n\nThese types of jumps in executive compensation may have more of an effect on our widening income inequality than previously thought. A new book thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the talk of academia and the media, Capital in the Twenty-First Century by Thomas Piketty, a 42-year-old who teaches at the Paris School of Economics, shows that two-thirds of AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s increase in income inequality over the past four decades is the result of steep raises given to the countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s highest earners.\n\nThis week, Bill talks with Nobel Prize-winning economist and New York Times columnist Paul Krugman, about PikettyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“magnificentÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ new book.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“What PikettyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s really done now is he said, Ã¢â‚¬ËœEven those of you who talk about the 1 percent, you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t really get whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s going on.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s telling us that we are on the road not just to a highly unequal society, but to a society of an oligarchy. A society of inherited wealth.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nKrugman adds: Ã¢â‚¬Å“WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re seeing inequalities that will be transferred across generations. We are becoming very much the kind of society we imagined weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re nothing like.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:52e5551438c9f710e0b0ff39e5463b6f64af1bc2","amp;dn":"What+the+1%25+Don%26rsquo%3Bt+Want+Yo+Know-Moyers041614","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"52e5551438c9f710e0b0ff39e5463b6f64af1bc2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,229,85,20,56,201,247,16,224,176,255,57,229,70,59,111,100,175,27,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
