Klabunde , Gleb B. Sergeev\n\n\nabout book :-\n\nThe second edition of Nanochemistry covers the main studies of nanoparticle production, reactions, and compounds, and reviews the work of leading scientists from around the world. This book is the first monograph on nanochemistry, giving perspectives on the present status and future possibilities in this rapidly advancing discipline. It provides the solid fundamentals and theory of nanoscience, and progress through topics including synthesis and stabilization of nanoparticles, cryochemistry of metal atoms and nanoparticles, chemical nanoreactors, and more.\n\nNanoparticles are capable of transformations that have already led to revolutionary applications, including reagents for self-cleaning glass surfaces and fabrics, different antiseptic coverings, sensors for monitoring the environment and catalysts mitigating pollution.\n\nLeads the reader through the theory, research and key applications of nanochemistry, providing a thorough reference for researchers\n40% more content than the first edition and an expanded author team\nReviews new advances in the field, including organic nanoparticles and key methods for making nanoparticles (e.g. solvated metal atom dispersion and self-assembly techniques)\n\nProduct Details :-\n\ntotal pages: 372 pages\nPublisher: Elsevier; 2 edition (February 26, 2013)\nLanguage: English\nISBN: 978-0444593979\nProduct Dimensions: 9.1 x 6.1 x 1.1 inches\n\n\n`~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`\n  SEED PLEASE , LET OTHERS GET IT TOO. \n `~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`\t\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:393d1580a89f12a935e7b14810cb848071620cd8","amp;dn":"Nanochemistry","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"393d1580a89f12a935e7b14810cb848071620cd8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,61,21,128,168,159,18,169,53,231,177,72,16,203,132,128,113,98,12,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
