Recorded in April 2005, the shows were filmed in the band's hometown of Atlanta during two special sold-out performances featuring the Atlanta Symphony Youth Orchestra. The 20-song collection spans ninety minutes and encompasses hits from Collective Soul's seven studio albums, including their latest release, &quot;Youth&quot;. DVD special features include behind the scenes footage and documentary, and the CD is enhanced with video, never before released music, and more. Recording in an orchestral setting enabled the group to reinterpret their hits. Songs such as &quot;Shine&quot;, &quot;December&quot;, &quot;The World I Know&quot;, and &quot;Precious Declaration&quot; have all been given a new twist. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a3b8f624ed99f1be4f492369cfb543e7619f4285","amp;dn":"Collective+Soul+-+Home+DVD+NTSC+%28Eng%29+%5BLowcroft%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a3b8f624ed99f1be4f492369cfb543e7619f4285","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,184,246,36,237,153,241,190,79,73,35,105,207,181,67,231,97,159,66,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
