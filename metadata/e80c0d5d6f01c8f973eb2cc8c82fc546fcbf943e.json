If the mountains have not already decided the winner then this stage will be critical in the battle for yellow. A rolling 54km between Bergerac and Perigueux, it is not a course necessarily suited to the specialists in the discipline like Martin or Cancellara, so quite a few riders could be in with a chance of glory today. Presented by Gary Imlach with analysis from Chris Boardman, commentary by Phil Liggett and Paul Sherwen with Ned Boulting the reporter at the roadside.\n\nTechnical Spec\nFilesize__: 480 MB\nRun-Time__: 45 min\nContainer_: MKV\nVideo_____: x264 CABAC Main L3.1 832x468 50fps CRF=25 ~1376Kbps\nAudio_____: HE-AAC VBR 2ch 24/48KHz Q=0.24 ~64Kbps\n\ndb.tt/wHGqEnKq\ntwitter[dot]com/JungleBoyNX\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e80c0d5d6f01c8f973eb2cc8c82fc546fcbf943e","amp;dn":"ITV.Tour.de.France.2014.Stage.20.Highlights.PDTV.x264-NX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e80c0d5d6f01c8f973eb2cc8c82fc546fcbf943e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,12,13,93,111,1,200,249,115,235,44,200,200,47,197,70,252,191,148,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
