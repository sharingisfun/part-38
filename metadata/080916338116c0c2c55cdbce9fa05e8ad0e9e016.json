Originally released as a three-issue magazine series in the acclaimed international Ã¢â‚¬Å“IgnatzÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ format, New Tales Old Palomar is finally collected into one handsome book. All three issues deal with the classic characters of Palomar such as sweet Pipo, her sharp-tongue sister Carmen, sheriff Chelo, and the gang of boys who help start it all: studious Heraclio, tall and fey Israel, disfigured but good-natured Vicente, and girl-crazy JesÃƒÂºs and Satch. In the first story, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Children of Palomar,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ mysterious, fast-moving thieves are stealing food from wherever they can grab it; Sheriff Chelo and some citizens do their best to solve this mystery, but nobody seems to be able to catch these bandits in action until Pipo puts her soccer-trained legs to work and goes after them herself. In the second, Gato, Soledad, Guero, Pintor, and Arturo go exploring a bottomless chasm and come face to face with... well, we wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t spoil the surprise. The third and last story focuses on one of PalomarÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most beloved characters, the gorgeous but troubled TonantzÃƒÂ­n: Everybody in Palomar seems to take the supernatural with a grain of salt, but young TonantzÃƒÂ­n is determined to uncover the mystery of the laughing baby that only appears to her, haunting her daily life. What is the babyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s link to the giant stone idols that stand outside the small town...?
