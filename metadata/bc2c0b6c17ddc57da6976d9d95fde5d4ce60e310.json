The Artful Parent has all the tools and information you need to encourage your childrenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s creativity through art. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn how to set up an art space, how to talk to children about their artwork, how to choose the best art supplies (without breaking the bank), how to repurpose and organize the piles of art created, and even how to use art activities to soften everyday transitions.\nThe more than sixty engaging arts and crafts projects included here are accessible and developmentally appropriate for one- to eight-year-olds, and theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re a far cry from the cookie-cutter crafts many of us did in school as kids. From bubble prints to musical chairs art, these activities allow children to explore art materials, techniques, and ideas as they grow more creative every day. With activities for downtimes, action art for releasing energy, and recipes for making your own art materials, this book is your guide for raising an artful family.\n\nAbout the Author &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img255.imageshack.us/img255/2460/hulbook.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img255.imageshack.us/img255/2460/hulbook.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\nJean VanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Hul, mother of two, lives with her family in the mountains of western North Carolina.
