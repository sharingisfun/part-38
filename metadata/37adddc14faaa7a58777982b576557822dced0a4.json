She can't stop thinking about him, but whenever she tries talking with him about the mysteries behind her feelings, he makes it clear that he wants nothing to do with her. Reaching him is even more difficult because she has a boyfriend, Jeremy, who has started to become full of himself after being elected co-captain of the varsity soccer team, and her flirtatious best friend Chelsea starts dating Drew soon after his arrival. So why can't she get him out of her mind?\n\nEven though Lizzie knows she should let go of her fascination with Drew, fighting fate isn't going to be easy.\n\nVengeance (Transcend Time, #2) \n\nWhen Chelsea Givens discovered that her ex-boyfriend Drew dumped her to be with her former best friend Lizzie, she'd never felt so betrayed in her life. Then her new friend Shannon tells her she can help set things right. Chelsea's willing to listen, but what Shannon wants her to believe -- that she shared a past life with Drew -- is impossible. And what she wants her to do to get him back Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ well, it's downright crazy.\n\nCould Shannon be telling the truth? And if she is, what lengths will Chelsea go if it means making Lizzie pay?\n\nFind out in Vengeance, the second part of the Transcend Time Saga.\n\n*Vengeance is the short story that bridges the events in Remembrance and the final novel in the Saga.\n\nTimeless (Transcend Time, #3) \n\nNow, strange things keep happening to Lizzie. Things that are omens of darkness to come. A curse has doomed her to die an early death, just as she did in her past life. To make matters worse, even if she can figure out who cast the curse, it's irreversible. There's only one option left for her to save herself. It's crazier than anything she's heard yet, and to do it, she'll need Drew and Chelsea's help.\n\nBecause to make things right, they must go back to when it all began ... and Lizzie discovers that the final events in her past life were more sinister than she ever imagined.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:37adddc14faaa7a58777982b576557822dced0a4","amp;dn":"Transcend+Time+Series+-+Michelle+Madow+%5BEpub%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"37adddc14faaa7a58777982b576557822dced0a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,173,221,193,79,170,167,165,135,119,152,43,87,101,87,130,45,206,208,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
