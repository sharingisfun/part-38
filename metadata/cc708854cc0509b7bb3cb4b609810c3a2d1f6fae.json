Entering the competition on a whim after walking past the local auditions in Glasgow, singer-songwriter Emma Gillespie, performing for the show as Emma's Imagination, consistently wowed the judges; Dizzee Rascal, Jamie Cullum and Sharleen Spiteri--and became the audience favourite with performances of self-penned songs &quot;Focus&quot; and &quot;This Day&quot; during the show's live final at Wembley Arena. The show offered a cash prize rather than a recording deal but, having caught the attention of both Gary Barlow and Polydor President Ferdy Unger-Hamilton--who describes her as a 'brilliant, original artist'--Emma signed to Polydor/Future Records. She recorded Stand Still in London with producer Martin Terefe (KT Tunstall, James Morrison). The album displays a lusher sound on some of the tracks, giving them the fullness Emma always heard in her head when playing them on her guitar. \n\nReleased(10 Jan 2011)\nNumber of Discs: 1\nLabel: Polydor\nBitrate:320\nFile size:78.1 MB\n\nTrack List\t\n\n \n\n   1.
