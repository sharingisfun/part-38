It is the only studio album to feature drummer Chris Slade, and includes &quot;Thunderstruck&quot; and &quot;Moneytalks,&quot; which are among AC/DC's most well-known tracks. The album reached #2 on the US Billboard 200 and #4 in the UK, a smash commercial success that returned the band to the popularity of its glory years between the mid-1970s and early 1980s. The album has been certified 5x platinum (5 million copies sold) in the US, and was re-released in 2003 as part of AC/DC's remasters series. The album was produced by Bruce Fairbairn. Malcolm Young, having completed his rehabilitation for alcoholism, once again played rhythm guitar and co-wrote (with his brother Angus) all the songs on the album.\n\n\nTrack listing\n\nAll songs written and composed by Angus Young and Malcolm Young. \n\nNo. \tTitle \tLength\n\n1. \t&quot;Thunderstruck&quot;   \t4:52\n2. \t&quot;Fire Your Guns&quot;   \t2:53\n3. \t&quot;Moneytalks&quot;   \t3:45\n4. \t&quot;The Razors Edge&quot;   \t4:22\n5. \t&quot;Mistress for Christmas&quot;   \t3:59\n6. \t&quot;Rock Your Heart Out&quot;   \t4:06\n7. \t&quot;Are You Ready&quot;   \t4:10\n8. \t&quot;Got You by the Balls&quot;   \t4:30\n9. \t&quot;Shot of Love&quot;   \t3:56\n10. \t&quot;Let's Make It&quot;   \t3:32\n11. \t&quot;Goodbye &amp; Good Riddance to Bad Luck&quot;   \t3:13\n12. \t&quot;If You Dare&quot;   \t3:08\n\n\nNOTE:\n\nExtension File Format: mp3\n\nBitrate: 128 kbps\n\n\nREAPER","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0afab59af10b3b05fb705e0c1a69f01cd3588121","amp;dn":"AC%2FDC.The+Razors+Edge.1990.Album","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0afab59af10b3b05fb705e0c1a69f01cd3588121","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,250,181,154,241,11,59,5,251,112,94,12,26,105,240,28,211,88,129,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
