After completing their studies, they go their different ways. Yash takes over from his father's (Paresh Rawal) nefarious and mafia-like business, while Suraj becomes an officer of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). Yash's dad is attacked by a rival, and he loses the use of his leg and is confined in a wheelchair. Yash marries his sweetheart Prathna (Shilpa Shetty). After completing his training successfully, Suraj is assigned the investigation against his friend, Yash, which shocks Suraj, but which he accepts. Yash's dad's contacts are many, and soon Yash also comes to know of Suraj's job, and his assignment. Suraj must now convince Yash that his father is not what he appears to be, and at the same time take criticism and pressure from his superiors for not proceeding with the investigation against Yash.\r\n\r\nSCREENSHOTS:-\r\n \nhttp://i1093.photobucket.com/albums/i437/SahibDM/1_2.png \nhttp://i1093.photobucket.com/albums/i437/SahibDM/2_2.png \nhttp://i1093.photobucket.com/albums/i437/SahibDM/3_1.png \nhttp://i1093.photobucket.com/albums/i437/SahibDM/4_1.png \nhttp://i1093.photobucket.com/albums/i437/SahibDM/5_1.png \nhttp://i1093.photobucket.com/albums/i437/SahibDM/6.png \nhttp://i1093.photobucket.com/albums/i437/SahibDM/7_1.png \nhttp://i1093.photobucket.com/albums/i437/SahibDM/8_1.png \nhttp://i1093.photobucket.com/albums/i437/SahibDM/9.png \nhttp://i1093.photobucket.com/albums/i437/SahibDM/10.png \nhttp://i1093.photobucket.com/albums/i437/SahibDM/11.png \nhttp://i1093.photobucket.com/albums/i437/SahibDM/12.png \nhttp://i1093.photobucket.com/albums/i437/SahibDM/13.png \nhttp://i1093.photobucket.com/albums/i437/SahibDM/14.png \nhttp://i1093.photobucket.com/albums/i437/SahibDM/15.png \nhttp://i1093.photobucket.com/albums/i437/SahibDM/16.png \nhttp://i1093.photobucket.com/albums/i437/SahibDM/17.png \nhttp://i1093.photobucket.com/albums/i437/SahibDM/18.png \nhttp://i1093.photobucket.com/albums/i437/SahibDM/19.png \nhttp://i1093.photobucket.com/albums/i437/SahibDM/20.png \nhttp://i1093.photobucket.com/albums/i437/SahibDM/21.png \nhttp://i1093.photobucket.com/albums/i437/SahibDM/22.png \nhttp://i1093.photobucket.com/albums/i437/SahibDM/23.png \nhttp://i1093.photobucket.com/albums/i437/SahibDM/24.png \nhttp://i1093.photobucket.com/albums/i437/SahibDM/25.png \nhttp://i1093.photobucket.com/albums/i437/SahibDM/26.png \nhttp://i1093.photobucket.com/albums/i437/SahibDM/27.png \nhttp://i1093.photobucket.com/albums/i437/SahibDM/28.png \nhttp://i1093.photobucket.com/albums/i437/SahibDM/29.png \nhttp://i1093.photobucket.com/albums/i437/SahibDM/30.png \nhttp://i1093.photobucket.com/albums/i437/SahibDM/31.png\r\n\r\nTHANK YOU!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:357ca658537d35a431bba3b14dc65f1fcc663e8c","amp;dn":"Auzaar+%281997%29+%7C+Salman+Khan+%7C+Sanjay+Kapoor+%7C+DVDRip+420p","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"357ca658537d35a431bba3b14dc65f1fcc663e8c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,124,166,88,83,125,53,164,49,187,163,177,77,198,95,31,204,102,62,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
