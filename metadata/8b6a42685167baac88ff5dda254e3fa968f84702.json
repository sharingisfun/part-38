Wicked Appetite [Lizzy &amp; Diesel, #1] - Janet Evanovich\n\nFor centuries, treasure hunters have been eager to possess the stones, undeterred by their corrupting nature. The list is long Ã¢â‚¬â€ Genghis Khan, Alexander the Great, Napoleon, to name a few. Now the Stones have found their way to Salem, Massachusetts, and so has Gerwulf Grimoire, adding himself to this roguesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ gallery of power seekers. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an uncommonly dangerous man, with a hunger for the forbidden, and a set of abilities that are way beyond ordinary. Abilities that he feels entitle him to possess anything he might desire.\n\nThat would include Elizabeth Tucker, the woman he needs to find the Stones. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s freshly transplanted from New York City to BostonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s North Shore. With a new job as pastry chef at DazzleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bakery and an old house inherited from her Aunt Ophelia, her life is pretty much on track Ã¢â‚¬Â¦until itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s suddenly derailed by a guy named Diesel, a rude monkey, and a ninja cat.\n\nLizzy can handle the monkey and the cat. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not sure about Diesel. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s offering up his own set of unusual talents, promising to protect her from Grimoire. The kind of protection that Lizzy suspects might involve guarding her body day and night.\n\nThe Seven Deadly Sins are pride, greed, lust, envy wrath, sloth and gluttony. That pretty much covers everything that is wicked. Diesel thinks it also pretty much covers everything thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fun. And Lizzy thinks Diesel and the Seven Deadly Sins cover everything her mother warned her about.\n\n02. Wicked Business [Lizzy &amp; Diesel, #2] - Janet Evanovich\n\nWhether itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s monkey business, funny business or getting down to business, Janet Evanovich's Lizzy and Diesel series proves that there's no business like Wicked Business\nLizzy Tucker's once normal life as a pastry chef in Salem, Massachusetts, turns upside down as she battles both sinister forces and an inconvenient attraction to her unnaturally talented but off-limits partner, Diesel.\n\nWhen Harvard University English professor and dyed-in-the-wool romantic Gilbert Reedy is mysteriously murdered and thrown off his fourth-floor balcony, Lizzy and Diesel take up his twenty-year quest for the Luxuria Stone, an ancient relic believed by some to be infused with the power of lust. Following clues contained in a cryptic nineteenth-century book of sonnets, Lizzy and Diesel tear through Boston catacombs, government buildings, and multimillion-dollar residences. On their way they'll leave behind a trail of robbed graves, public disturbances, and general mayhem.\n\nDiesel's black sheep cousin, Gerwulf Grimoire, also wants the Stone. His motives are far from pure, and what he plans on doing with the treasure, no one knows...but Lizzy Tucker fears she's in his crosshairs. Never far and always watching, Grimoire has a growing, vested interest in the cupcake-baker-turned-finder-of-lost-things. As does another dangerous and dark opponent in the hunt - a devotee of lawlessness and chaos, known only as Anarchy.\n\nTreasures will be sought, and the power of lust will be unmistakable as Lizzy and Diesel attempt to stay ahead of Anarchy, Grimoire, and his medieval minion, Hatchet, in this ancient game of twisted riddles and high-stakes hide-and-seek.\n\n03. Wicked Charms [Lizzy &amp; Diesel, #3] - Janet Evanovich\n\n\nLizzy and Diesel return once again in an all-new adventure in the #1 New York Times bestselling series from Janet Evanovich and her co-author, Phoef Sutton!\n\nMurdered and mummified more than ninety years ago, bootlegger Collier Ã¢â‚¬Å“Peg LegÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Dazzle once found and re-hid a famous pirateÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s treasure somewhere along the coast of New England. A vast collection of gold and silver coins and precious gems, the bounty also contains the Stone of Avarice Ã¢â‚¬â€ the very item reluctant treasure seeker, Lizzy Tucker, and her partner, Diesel, have been enlisted to find. While Lizzy would just like to live a quiet, semi-normal life, Diesel is all about the hunt. And this hunt is going to require a genuine treasure map and a ship worthy of sailing the seven seas . . . or at least getting them from Salem Harbor to Maine.\n\nGreed is eternal and insatiable, and Lizzy and Diesel arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t the only ones searching for the lost pirateÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s chest. There are people who have dedicated their entire lives to finding it, and are willing to commit murder or make a deal with the devil, just to hold the fortune in their hands. One of those people may even be Wulf, DieselÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s deceptively charming and enigmatic cousin. Wulf desires the Stone of Avarice. He also desires Lizzy. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hard to say how far heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s willing to go to gain either one.\n\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a swashbuckling adventure full of raiders, monkeys, minions, and mayhem. Lizzy and Diesel are going to have to do everything they can to keep their heads above water and hope they are living a charmed life","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b6a42685167baac88ff5dda254e3fa968f84702","amp;dn":"Lizzy+%26amp%3B+Diesel+Series+-+Janet+Evanovich","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b6a42685167baac88ff5dda254e3fa968f84702","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,106,66,104,81,103,186,172,136,255,93,218,37,78,63,169,104,248,71,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
