'Get Out of Town' and 'So and So' are among the most swinging recordings from Holly and company, and her renditions of the standard ballads 'Blame it On My Youth' and 'Don't Smoke in Bed' are simply exquisite.  But it's her musical excursions that shine the brightest here: the jazzy soul of Sly and the Family Stone's 'Everyday Like a Holiday,'  the stark pop balladry of 'Don't Let the Teardrops Rust Your Shining Heart,' and the incarnation of 'I Can See Clearly Now' into an earthy pop tune are nothing short of breathtaking.  And for proof of Holly's interpretive skills and her gift for arranging, look no further than 'Que Sera Sera,' the corny song even Doris Day herself couldn't stand, transformed here into a downright sexy blues number.  Anyone who thinks the most talented singers write their own material need to listen to 'Don't Smoke in Bed.'  Holly proves that a gifted artist doesn't always use a notebook and pen. ~ John Jones 'Musician'\n\nHolly Cole brings her own dimension to the tradition of cabaret, a strong voice that's still capable of nuance, an ear for quirky repertoire, and a light touch that keeps some of these performances floating just at the edge of irony.  Her delivery of more traditional fare shines on Cole Porter's witty 'Get Out of Town' and Kurt Weill's torchy 'Je Ne T'aime Pas,' while she brings clarity, power, and anthemic passion to the surprising treatment of Johnny Nash's 'I Can See Clearly Now.' Some of her inspirations are less successful, such as aiming for jazz depth on the lightweight pop of 'Que Sera Sera,' but Cole is never less than interesting.  She's generally well supported in this intimate art by pianist Aaron Davis and bassist David Piltch, while there's sparing and effective use of strings.  There are fine guest spots by tenor saxophonist Joe Henderson, on 'Everyday Will Be Like a Holiday,' and David Lindley, whose steel guitar contributes to the strange country music of 'Don't Let the Teardrops Rust Your Shining Heart.' ~ Adam Rains, Amazon.com\n\nPersonnel:\nHolly Cole (Vocals) \nAaron Davis (Piano) \nDavid Piltch (Double Bass and Percussion) \n\nGuests:\nHoward Lewy (Harmonica) - 3,5,11 \nArt Avalos (Percussion) - 8 \nJoe Henderson (Tenor Saxophone) - 6 \nDavid Lindley (Lap Steel Guitar) - 2 \n\nHolly Cole Trio - Don't Smoke in Bed (1993) Tracks:\n01  I Can See Clearly Now (Johnny Nash) 4:13 \n02  Don't Let the Teardrops Rust Your Shining Heart (Ben Watt) 4:19\n03  Get Out of Town (Cole Porter) 4:42 \n04  So and So (Mary Margaret O'Hara) 3:27 \n05  The Tennessee Waltz (Pee Wee King/Redd Stewart) 3:40 \n06  Everyday Will Be Like a Holiday (William Bell/Booker T.
