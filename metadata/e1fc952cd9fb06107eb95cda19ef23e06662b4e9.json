Drawing as it does from the prime years of Muddy's career (1947-1960), this compilation does double duty as an illuminating document offering a formerly unavailable perspective, and a tour through the premier Chicago bluesman's artistic development.\nThe earliest tunes, recorded for the Chess brothers' Aristocrat label, show a young Muddy in stripped-down, drumless mode, still bearing the influence of Delta blues. The 1948 cut &quot;You're Gonna Miss Me,&quot; a proto-rockabilly tune waxed nearly a decade prior to Elvis's breakthrough, posits Muddy as the true father of rock &amp; roll. Muddy's turbocharged '50s style is represented here by the titanic resonance of &quot;Iodine in My Coffee&quot; and Howlin' Wolf's signature tune &quot;Smokestack Lightnin'.&quot; By the end of the '50s, Muddy had his Hoochie Coochie Man persona down to a science, as shown by 1958's sinuous, unapologetically lustful &quot;Born Lover.&quot; \n\n\nTracklist\n1.
