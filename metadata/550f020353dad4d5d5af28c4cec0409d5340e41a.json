The grisly discovery of several corpses is made in a small town. A bloody incident during the attempt to capture the alleged murderer leaves two police officers dead and another badly injured. The surviving officer Zhang Zili is suspended from duty; he takes a job as a security guard at a factory. Five years later, another series of mysterious murders occurs. Aided by a former colleague, Zhang decides to investigate under his own initiative. He discovers that all the victims were connected to Wu Zhizhen, a young woman who works at a dry cleaners. Pretending to be a customer, Zhang begins to observe her and finds himself falling in love with the reticent Wu Zhizhen. One cold winter's day he makes a horrific discovery. His life now in danger, he realises it is not always possible to separate guilt from innocence. Diao Yinan's use of the characters of the ex-police officer and the femme fatale is a direct reference to classic detective films. This director's third feature is a noirish thriller in drained colours which, whilst playfully alluding to the genre, also invites us into the lives of very ordinary people. \r\n\r\nA stark, harsh murder mystery interspersed with Wong Kar-wai-esque moments of odd urban beauty.\r\n- Ross McIndoe, The Skinny\r\n\r\nA masterpiece of framing and composition, Diao Yinan's Black Coal, Thin Ice is a rare kind of film \r\nin which no shot feels unconsidered or out of place\r\n- Tom Clift, Movie Mezzanine\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTARS.........: Fan Liao, Lun Mei Gwei, Xuebing Wang\r\nDIRECTOR......: Yi'nan Diao\r\nWRITERS.......: Yi'nan Diao\r\nGENRE.........: Crime | Drama | Mystery \r\nRATING........: 6.6/10  3,766 votes\r\nIMDB LINK.....: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3469910\r\nRUNTIME.......: 1h 49mn\r\nSIZE..........: 3.53 GiB\r\nVIDEO CODEC...: x264 (  )\r\nRESOLUTION....: 1920x1040\r\nBITRATE.......: 4000 Kbps (3-Pass)\r\nFRAMERATE.....: 23.976 fps\r\nAUDIO.........: Chinese AC3 5.1 640kbps\r\nSOURCE........: Bluray\r\nSUBTITLES.....: ENG\r\nCHAPTERS......: No\r\nENCODED BY....: Sartre\r\nENCODE DATE...: 2015-01-08\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \nhttp://imagizer.imageshack.com/img538/4439/jTrfQg.jpg \nhttp://imagizer.imageshack.com/img537/684/nXfuY9.jpg \nhttp://imagizer.imageshack.com/img661/6691/GP8mt1.jpg \nhttp://imagizer.imageshack.com/img905/5303/tBaVLV.jpg","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:550f020353dad4d5d5af28c4cec0409d5340e41a","amp;dn":"Black.Coal.Thin.Ice.2014.1080p.BluRay.x264.AC3-SARTRE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"550f020353dad4d5d5af28c4cec0409d5340e41a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,15,2,3,83,218,212,213,213,175,40,196,206,192,64,157,83,64,228,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
