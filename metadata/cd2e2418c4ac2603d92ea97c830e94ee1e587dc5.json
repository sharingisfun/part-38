Five shameless contestants with little to gain and nothing to lose take to the stage in a gay nightclub for a chance to achieve go go boy glory and a $1000 cash prize. On the judging panel are a burned out porn star, a Celine Dion &quot;embodier,&quot; and the raunchy nightclub owner - all of whom threaten to steal the spotlight from the fame-hungry, back-stabbing contestants. Starring iconic drag comedian Hedda Lettuce, gay adult film star Jake Steel, and some sexy broadway actors, Go Go Crazy is a hilarious, outrageous mockumentary from director Fred M. Caruso (The Big Gay Musical). With a little sex, sabotage, and dirty tricks, this movie will turn you on, bend you over with laughter, and then give you a happy ending.\n\n\n01:17:48\n640x352\n23.976 FPS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd2e2418c4ac2603d92ea97c830e94ee1e587dc5","amp;dn":"2011+Go+Go+Crazy+%28USA%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd2e2418c4ac2603d92ea97c830e94ee1e587dc5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,46,36,24,196,172,38,3,217,46,169,124,131,14,148,238,30,88,125,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
