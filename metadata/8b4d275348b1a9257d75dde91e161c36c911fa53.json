Mike is a seventeen-year-old bookie, and Sanctuary is where she takes bets for anyone at Carson City High with enough cash. Her only rule: Never participate, never place a bet for herself.\n\nThen Josh Ellison moves to town. He pushes Mike to live her life, to feel a rush of somethingÃ¢â‚¬â€play the game, he urges, stop being a spectator.\n\nSo Mike breaks her one rule. She places a bet, feels the rush.\n\nAnd loses.\n\nIn an act of desperation, she and JoshÃ¢â‚¬â€who has a sordid past of his ownÃ¢â‚¬â€concoct a plan: The pair will steal from Carson City's elite to pay back Mike's debt. Then they'll give the rest of their haul to those who need it most. How can burglary be wrong if they are making things right?\n\nWanted will thrust readers into the gritty underbelly of Carson City, where worth is determined by a score, power is derived from threat, and the greatest feat is surviving it all.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b4d275348b1a9257d75dde91e161c36c911fa53","amp;dn":"Wanted+-+Heidi+Ayarbe.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b4d275348b1a9257d75dde91e161c36c911fa53","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,77,39,83,72,177,169,37,125,117,221,233,30,22,28,54,201,17,250,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
