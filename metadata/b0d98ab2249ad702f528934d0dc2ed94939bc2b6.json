The story picks up after the Companions of the Lance have helped a group of slaves escape from the mines of Pax Tharkas. The group takes refuge in a mountain valley, where they hope to be safe from their former masters. When the illusion of security is dispelled by the appearance of one of their old enemies, the heroes take action. They seek out the lost dwarven stronghold of Thorbardin, hoping that the dwarves that still remain within will give shelter to the refugees through the winter. However, this sanctuary comes with a cost. The Companions are forced to take up a quest for the fabled Hammer of Kharas. The story is weighted with exposition that drags down what has the potential to be an exciting plot. While the characters may be old friends to returning readers, those new to the Chronicles will find them flat and underdeveloped. Sandra Burr&amp;#039;s clear, melodic voice guides listeners carefully along the journey. While she skillfully provides distinct voices for a large cast of characters, some of them grate on the ears. This recording will be in demand by fans of the previous books, but it will not draw in new listeners.ÃƒÂ¢??Heather Dieffenbach, Lexington Public Library, Beaumont Branch, KY \nCopyright Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â© Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.
