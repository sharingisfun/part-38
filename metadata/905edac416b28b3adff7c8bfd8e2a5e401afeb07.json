Just a quick stopover to handle the sale of an old automaton factory hidden in the alpine valleys, then straight back home to New York. Little did she imagine, when embarking on this task, that her life would be turned upside down.\n\nOn her expedition across Europe, traveling from Western Europe to the far reaches of Eastern Russia, she encounters a host of incredible individuals and locations full of extraordinary machines and an amazing atmosphere. In her attempt to track down Hans, the genius inventor - the final key to unlock the secret of Syberia - she will traverse both land and time on a journey that will throw all that she values into question, while the deal she sets out to sign turns into a life-changing experience.\n\n-------------\n\nIF YOU HAVE ANY REQUESTS, PLEASE WRITE THEM IN COMMENTS, ENJOY AND DON'T FORGET TO SEED IT BACK.\n\nWAITING ON THE REQUEST LIST TO BE UPLOADED:\n\nFAR CRY\nFAR CRY 2: FORTUNE'S EDITION\nMEDAL OF HONOR: ALLIED ASSAULT WAR CHEST\t\nGOTHIC 1, 2, 3\nIN COLD BLOOD\nHEROES OF MIGHT AND MAGIC 5 BUNDLE\nINQUISITOR\nDaikatana\nMessiah\nChildren of the Nile Complete\nStill Life 1\nGhost Master\nGemini Rue\nTo The Moon\nDarwinia\nAlan Wake American Nightmare\nTwo Worlds 1+2\n\n--------------\nREQUESTS THAT I CAN'T FULFILL AT THE MOMENT\n\nLeisure Suit Larry Language Pack\nDon't Starve\nKing of Dragon Pass\nGalactic Civilizations I Ultimate Edition\nThe Cat Lady\nJourneyman Project 3\nDYAD\nSword of the Stars: The Pit\nEtherlords 2\nBioforge\nAvernum: The Complete Saga\nRetro City Rampage\n\n\n\n--------------\n\nIF POSSIBLE, DON'T FORGET TO SUPPORT THE COMPANIES AND GOG.COM FOR THEIR GREAT SERVICE.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:905edac416b28b3adff7c8bfd8e2a5e401afeb07","amp;dn":"Syberia+%5BGoG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"905edac416b28b3adff7c8bfd8e2a5e401afeb07","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,94,218,196,22,178,139,58,223,247,200,191,216,226,165,228,1,175,235,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
