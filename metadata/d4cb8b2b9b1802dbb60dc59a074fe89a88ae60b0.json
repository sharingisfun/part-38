But things are messed up: theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve lost the real John Hudson, and they find what seems to be the fabled Northwest PassageÃ¢â‚¬â€even though they are pretty sure that that route doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t actually exist. Will this new version of history replace the real past? Is this the end of time as we know it? With more at stake than ever before, Jonah and Katherine struggle to unravel the mysteries of 1611 and the Hudson Passage...before everything they know is lost.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d4cb8b2b9b1802dbb60dc59a074fe89a88ae60b0","amp;dn":"Torn+%28The+Missing%2C+%234%29+-+Margaret+Peterson+Haddix.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d4cb8b2b9b1802dbb60dc59a074fe89a88ae60b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,203,139,43,155,24,2,219,182,13,197,154,7,79,232,154,136,174,96,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
