National Geogrphic's Ã¢â‚¬Å“Killing LincolnÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is based on the book by Bill OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Reilly and Martin Dugard, puts its focus just where the title suggests: on the final days of LincolnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life and the pursuit of those behind the assassination. And yes, for anyone who canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get enough of the 16th president, on Sunday it will be possible to arrange a Lincoln trifecta, seeing Ã¢â‚¬Å“Lincoln,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Salvador LitvakÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s new film; Ã¢â‚¬Å“Saving LincolnÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (about the presidentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bodyguard); and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Killing LincolnÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in a single day. Happy belated birthday, Abe. \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Killing LincolnÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ mixes narration with re-enactments to tell a ticktock version of John Wilkes BoothÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s plot to kill the president. \n\nThe general story of how Booth and his co-conspirators tried to cripple the government Ã¢â‚¬â€ by simultaneously killing the president, Vice President Andrew Johnson and Secretary of State William H. Seward Ã¢â‚¬â€ is well known, but Ã¢â‚¬Å“Killing LincolnÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ does a pretty good job of conjuring the actual attacks, surely among the most shocking few hours in American history. (Seward was seriously wounded but lived; JohnsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s would-be attacker got cold feet.) \n\nOne thing that stands out, especially given that this was the first assassination of an American president, is the clear-headed response of a particular cabinet member in the hour after the 10:13 p.m. shooting at FordÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Theater, when Lincoln, still alive, had been taken to a boardinghouse. \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Shortly after 11 p.m.,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Mr. Hanks relates, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Secretary of War Edwin Stanton sets up a headquarters in the back parlor of the house and establishes relays between there and the War Department telegraph operators. He alerts General Grant and calls him back to Washington, issues emergency directives to police and military authorities, orders the National Detective Police to initiate a manhunt for the as-yet-unknown assassin and notifies Vice President Johnson that the president is dying.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ \n\nThe ticktock technique, often effective in print, has a ghoulish breathlessness to it on film Ã¢â‚¬â€ Mr. Hanks repeatedly reminds us how long Lincoln and then Booth had to live. But those who can overlook that will find a wealth of detail here that brings the tale to life. \n\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no secret that Booth broke his leg, either when he jumped from LincolnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s box or when his horse fell later, but here we learn that it was Ã¢â‚¬Å“a clean break of his fibula, two inches above the instep of his left foot.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ \n\nWe learn, too, that Dr. Charles A. Leale, the surgeon who was the first to treat Lincoln and stayed with him for the nine hours until he died, was just 23. We learn that the Ã¢â‚¬Å“wantedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ posters for the conspirators were the first to use photographs of suspects and that James Tanner, the stenographer who began taking witness testimony almost immediately after the shooting, was a Civil War veteran who had lost both legs in battle. \n\nSmall things, perhaps, but the difference between dry history and history lived by actual human beings. In the filmÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s final moments we see some of those human beings: photographs of BoothÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s co-conspirators, made after they were taken into custody. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an eerie, effective flourish. \n\n\n\nCast: \n\nBilly Campbell ... Abraham Lincoln\n \nJesse Johnson ... John Wilkes Booth\n \nGeraldine Hughes ... Mary Todd Lincoln\n \nKam Dabrowski ...
