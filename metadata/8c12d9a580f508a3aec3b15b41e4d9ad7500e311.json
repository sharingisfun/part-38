Luckily, the Oboro ninja clan has since reformed. As Hibana, kunoichi (female ninja) of the Oboro clan, you are charged with the task of finding the pieces of the Akujiki before Nakatomi does.\n\nNightshade is a sequel to Overworks' Shinobi for the PS2. Like its predecessor, it features several levels full of challenging enemies to fight using a combination of your sword, shuriken, and magic scrolls. Speed and stealth remain the emphasis, as you use stealth dashes and the ability to walk on walls to perform long strings of kills called tates. One of the main improvements to the gameplay system is the ability to create much larger combos/tates. In order to facilitate this, they've expanded the battle system to include flying kicks to break your opponent's guard and stealth attacks to kill unsuspecting foes in a single blow.\n \n\nFeatures:\n\n* Fly higher, move faster, and dole out even more damage as the kunoichi or Hibana.\n\n* Enhanced combat system provides greater depth, all-new attacks, and intense \n  aerial action.\n\n* Improved &quot;Tate&quot; system supports unlimited combos and a wider variety of attacks.\n\n* Unique scenarios allow you to fight atop fighter jets, moving trains, and \n  industrial cranes.\n\n* Perform combos to fill the new &quot;Chakra Gauge&quot; in order to perform powerful ninja\n  magic.\n\n* Use consecutive stealth dashes to surround your opponents and unleash the \n  deadly &quot;Shadow Dance&quot;.\n\n\nGame Pics Included.\n\n\nBurn with DVD Decrypter, (Included in download).  \n\nBurn at 8x or 4x Speed.\n\nUse Verbatim or Taiyo Yuden DVD Media for best quality, or if other media isn't \nworking.\n\n\nAny Problems or questions please post a comment.\n\n\nIf this is working fine for you let us know write a comment.\n\n\nPlease Seed this when your done.\n\n(I can't seed 24/7, do your part and seed to keep the torrent healthy).\n\n\n\nEnjoy!\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c12d9a580f508a3aec3b15b41e4d9ad7500e311","amp;dn":"Nightshade+%5BNtsc%5D%2C+Ps2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c12d9a580f508a3aec3b15b41e4d9ad7500e311","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,18,217,165,128,245,8,163,174,195,177,91,65,228,217,173,117,0,227,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
