It was released in the United Kingdom on the 12 January 2004 and in the USA on 9 February, both through Domino Records. It was released on CD, 7&quot; vinyl, and as a DVD single with the video promo and a short interview with the band.\n\nThe single reached #3 in the UK Singles Chart. It reached #3 on the US Modern Rock Tracks chart and #66 on the US Billboard Hot 100. The song was voted the best single of 2004 by the Village Voice Pazz &amp; Jop poll, and #1 on Australian youth radio network Triple J's Hottest 100 of the same year.\n\nThe promotional video for the song was directed by Jonas Odell. It includes the band in the midst of a somewhat Pythonesque (surreal Terry Gilliam style) animation involving quirky vintage figures and machinery. The video is a blend of the live action band superimposed into a 3D environment with animated 2D elements.\n\nFranz Ferdinand frontman Alex Kapranos explained the many and varied influences behind the '30s-style promo for second single &quot;Take Me Out&quot;.\n\n&quot;It's kind of two dimensional in a three dimensional style if that makes any sense. It's a montage of images; ourselves, pictures and things taken from other places and put together in a strange, abstract way. That's what gives the video that strange, jerky, style.\n\n&quot;The idea came out of stuff we'd been talking about as a band - we all like the photo montage style that you get from the dada artists who would literally cut up photographs and make new images with the pieces. You get this strange, disjointed look where limbs and heads aren't the same proportions. So you get a very jarring effect.\n\n&quot;We wanted to combine that with other ideas, like those old films from the 1930s that were directed by Busby Berkely; he would have these geometric shapes formed by dancers, chorus girls all making these fantastic shapes in water. But we wanted to take it further; he'd use the human shape to make these abstract shapes and we wanted to take it further by using limbs and arms and repeat them to make the human form even less human. So we have a lot of that in the video too, a lot of legs kicking in the air and arms moving to create that same sort of effect.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8619091fa6d1e7e2be9f224e417db5b2c7c868b6","amp;dn":"Franz+Ferdinand+-+Take+Me+Out","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8619091fa6d1e7e2be9f224e417db5b2c7c868b6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,25,9,31,166,209,231,226,190,159,34,78,65,125,181,178,199,200,104,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
