And in C/O Hansson &amp; Karlsson he plays a Hammond B3 organ. On his new album we also get to hear Peder create music with the help of mandolin, percussion, drums, bass, accordion and spokes. He has deconstructed and reconstructed his music and created something that feels familiar and still refreshing. Peder af Ugglas' first solo album Autumn Shuffle from 2005, was extremely well received all over the world. The acclaimed follow-up Beyond was released in 2007. In 2010 the third, self-titled album also received critical acclaim nationally and internationally. No. 4 contains 10 original songs from one of the best guitar players Sweden can offer.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af9048e8dad275d566d0ec2ba0c62e94823e50c4","amp;dn":"Peder+Af+Ugglas+-+No+4+%5B2012%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af9048e8dad275d566d0ec2ba0c62e94823e50c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,144,72,232,218,210,117,213,102,208,236,43,160,198,46,148,130,62,80,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
