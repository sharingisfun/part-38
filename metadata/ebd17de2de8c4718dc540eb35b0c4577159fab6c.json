Not recommended for the weak-hearted though, it contains lots of violence and gore (even though it's b/w).\n\nHave a nice time reading!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ebd17de2de8c4718dc540eb35b0c4577159fab6c","amp;dn":"Frank+Miller+-+Sin+City+%C2%A9+1991+Dark+Horse+Comics","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ebd17de2de8c4718dc540eb35b0c4577159fab6c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,209,125,226,222,140,71,24,220,84,14,179,91,12,69,119,21,159,171,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
