An average domestic garden becomes a perilous terrain, fraught with wasp attacks, skulking spiders, and bad-tempered millipedes. Will Nigel and the team make it back to their car to be re-enlarged in time? Or will they become lunch for a ravenous garden shrew? This fun documentary provides an adventure that will educate and entertain, making it perfect for the whole family. There are an estimated 8000 species in the average garden, so there's plenty to see.\n\n\n4)  Big Cats \nNigel Marven, a genial presenter who comes across like a hybrid of Steve Irwin and Russ Abbott, is very much an 'up close and personal' man and in this programme he's getting close to the big cats. He tracks them down in Africa, India and Siberia, keeping us posted all the time about how he's feeling - 'My heart's hammering,' 'I am never going to forget this,' 'It's been like a dream' We've all seen big cats on nature programmes before, but I wanted to see them in the flesh to reveal new insights into their behaviour. The world's top five big cats are the ones that can roar; leopard, snow leopard, jaguar, lion and tiger. I met them all, jumping into the midst of a pack of lions to show that truly wild lions fear man. It was a scary moment, but I knew they'd scatter when they saw me, and fortunately I was right! I also tracked tigers from elephant back in India, but the high point came over the sub-zero snows of Siberia. We managed to sight a 10-foot Siberian tiger padding\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img526.imageshack.us/img526/5197/microsafariscreen0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img526.imageshack.us/img526/5197/microsafariscreen0.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img151.imageshack.us/img151/1528/microsafariscreen1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img151.imageshack.us/img151/1528/microsafariscreen1.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img99.imageshack.us/img99/432/microsafariscreen2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img99.imageshack.us/img99/432/microsafariscreen2.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img3.imageshack.us/img3/6757/microsafariscreen3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img3.imageshack.us/img3/6757/microsafariscreen3.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img805.imageshack.us/img805/999/microsafariscreen4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img805.imageshack.us/img805/999/microsafariscreen4.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img834.imageshack.us/img834/3409/microsafariscreen5.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img834.imageshack.us/img834/3409/microsafariscreen5.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img266.imageshack.us/img266/6110/microsafariscreen6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img266.imageshack.us/img266/6110/microsafariscreen6.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img641.imageshack.us/img641/9826/microsafariscreen7.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img641.imageshack.us/img641/9826/microsafariscreen7.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1538 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 416\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.731 (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 192 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 72.Mins\n * Number Of Parts: 4\n * Part Size: 896 MB\n * Source: DVD\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n * Part 2: 350 MB 25mins\n * Part 3 &amp;:4: 746 MB 50mins\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro_Safari:_Journey_to_the_Bugs&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro_Safari:_Journey_to_the_Bugs&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:61fdf4250bb7bbed1ea9d7c34d4c9d46a9f743ef","amp;dn":"ITV+Micro+Safari+4of4+Big+Cats+XviD+AC3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"61fdf4250bb7bbed1ea9d7c34d4c9d46a9f743ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,253,244,37,11,183,187,237,30,169,215,195,77,76,157,70,169,247,67,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
