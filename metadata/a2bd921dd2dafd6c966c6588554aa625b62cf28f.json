This highly respected guide has been thoroughly updated and revised for content and design - it is now produced in full color! It introduces a logical theory of photographic lighting so if you are starting out in photography you will learn how to predict results before setting up lights. This is not primarily a how-to book with only set examples for you to copy. Rather, Light: Science and Magic provides you with a comprehensive theory of the nature and principles of light to allow you to use lighting to express your own creativity.\n\nNumerous photographs and illustrations provide clear examples of the theories, while sidebars highlight special lighting questions. Expanded chapters on available light in portraiture, as well as new information on digital equipment and terminology make this a must have update!\n\n*New four color art package with contemporary lighting examples\n*Based on the behaviour of light\n*Theory book for serious photographers\nSee all Editorial Reviews\nProduct Details\n\n    * Paperback: 320 pages\n    * Publisher: Focal Press; 3rd edition (March 21, 2007)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 0240808193\n    * ISBN-13: 978-0240808192","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2bd921dd2dafd6c966c6588554aa625b62cf28f","amp;dn":"Light%3A+Science+and+Magic%3A+An+Introduction+to+Photographic+Lighti","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a2bd921dd2dafd6c966c6588554aa625b62cf28f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,189,146,29,210,218,253,108,150,108,101,136,85,74,166,37,182,44,242,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
