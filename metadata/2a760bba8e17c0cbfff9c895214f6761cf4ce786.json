This part looks at the war with Persia and the effects of democracy.\n\nNote: for all those interested in more details on the battles, weapons and statistics, i highly recommend the documentary at&amp;#039;last stand of the 300&amp;#039; History channel.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe Greeks - Classical Greece of the 4th and 5th centuries, B.C. was a magnificent civilization that\nlaid the foundations for modern science, politics, warfare, and philosophy, and produced some of the\nmost breathtaking art and architecture the world has ever known.\n\nThrough the eyes and words of the great heroes of ancient Greece, this dazzling production charts\nthe rise, triumph, and eventual decline of the world&amp;#039;s first democracy.\n\nNow, through dramatic storytelling and state-of-the-art computer animation, you witness history,\nart, and government with giants like Pericles, Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle.\n\nfor more info goto http://www.pbs.org/empires/thegreeks/htmlver/index.html\n\nTitle: Empires - The Greeks: Crucible of Civilization\nDirector: Cassian Harrison\nActor: Liam Neeson\nRelease: 2001-02-13\n\nSpecs.\nGeneral\nFormat : Matroska\nFile size : 745 MiB\nPlayTime : 55mn 1s\nBit rate : 1892 Kbps\nWriting application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.10.2 (build 2540/release)\nWriting library : libebml-0.7.5 &amp; libmatroska-0.7.7\nVideo #1\nCodec : Intel H.264\nCodec/Info : Intel H.264\nPlayTime : 55mn 1s\nWidth : 720 pixels\nHeight : 528 pixels\nAspect ratio : 16:9\nFrame rate : 25.000 fps\nResolution : 12 bits\nAudio #2\nCodec : Vorbis\nBit rate mode : VBR\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 48 KHz\n\nand for all those interested, this file was converted using Gordian Knot RipPack.0.35.0 &amp; Gordian.Knot.Codec.Pack.1.9. From my limited research, i believe that H264 is approximately 40% more efficient than Divx/Xvid - which means better quality. MKV i believe allows for surround sound, whereas avi is only stereo, however this file is in stereo.\nif anyone has troubles playing the file, install the K-lite codec pack and play the file using &amp;#039;The KMPlayer&amp;#039;, imo the best media player - (it plays files which are not even 100% complete).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a760bba8e17c0cbfff9c895214f6761cf4ce786","amp;dn":"the+Greeks+Crucible+of+Civilazation+pt+2+%28reseed%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a760bba8e17c0cbfff9c895214f6761cf4ce786","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,118,11,186,142,23,192,203,255,249,200,149,33,79,103,97,207,76,231,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
