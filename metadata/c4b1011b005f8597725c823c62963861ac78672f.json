The Human Galactic Alliance has been constantly fighting for its survival against a grotesque race of beings called &quot;Hidiaazu.&quot; During an intense battle, the young lieutenant Redo and his humanoid mobile weapon Chamber are swallowed up into a distortion of time and space. Waking from his artificially induced hibernation, Redo realizes that he has arrived on Earth, the planet on the lost frontier. On this planet that was completely flooded by the seas, people live in fleets of giant ships, salvaging relics from the seas' depths in order to survive. Redo arrives on one of the fleets called Gargantia. With no knowledge of the planet's history or culture, he is forced to live alongside Amy, a 15-year-old girl who serves as a messenger aboard the Gargantia fleet. To Redo, who has lived a life where he knows nothing but fighting, these days of peace continue to surprise him.\n\n\nAired: Apr 7, 2013 to ?\nEpisodes: 12 (Season 1)\n\n\nProps to [HorribleSubs] for making these rips.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4b1011b005f8597725c823c62963861ac78672f","amp;dn":"%5BHorribleSubs%5D+Suisei+no+Gargantia+-+09+%5B720p%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c4b1011b005f8597725c823c62963861ac78672f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,177,1,27,0,95,133,151,114,92,130,60,98,150,56,97,172,120,103,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
