Chaos League brings together sports, fantasy and brutal, chaotic action on a playing field where the primary objectives are typical but the gameplay is anything but.\n\nPlayers must score points, win games, advance to championship rounds, and of course play for the ultimate trophy, but Chaos League serves up some extra excitement with its absence of rules, corrupt referees and mythical, powerful opponents from a very different type of league. As with any good RTS, players have to adapt their strategies to win but it will be worth the reward for any hard-core gamer looking for a new, original, fierce experience that will have them sweating until the final score hits the board.\n\n    * 10 races covering 70 different types of players, including monsters and star players. Each race has its own style of play and its own strategy for moving up the championship ladder. Each match takes place on different pitches with their own special atmosphere.\n    * 170 spells and skills to improve your players or to unsettle the opposing team during a match. Some skills are active and others are passive. Many depend on the experience level of the creature. Players must strategically manage their magic energy for spells.\n    * A slightly unusual atmosphere with doping, corruption, pre-match hooliganism, trap-setting and working the spectators during a match. A solo mode with tutorials and a Quick Match mode with 80 teams.\n    * A career mode which implies, over and above playing matches, the creation and management of a team during a championship or a cup. Beyond the classic game-play of trading players, hiring star players, pom-pom girls or a physio, the successful management of a team hinges on the individual progress of a player through the aggregation of his various experiences.\n    * A multi-player mode via LAN or Internet. Possibility for one-off matches, knock-out competitions or League Tables.\n    * A replay mode that allows you to go over your matches whenever you want to analyze the relative strengths and weaknesses of your opponents.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e128c684f32c078a9b4ea3c9e646926665c403bf","amp;dn":"Chaos+League+%5BMultilingual+-+ENG-GER-FR%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e128c684f32c078a9b4ea3c9e646926665c403bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,40,198,132,243,44,7,138,155,78,163,201,230,70,146,102,101,196,3,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
