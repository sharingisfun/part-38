It is composed of five singers and a drummer. van Canto fuses a cappella (non-instrumental vocal music) with heavy/speed metal, creating what they call &quot;a capella metal&quot;. While only two of the five singers perform the lead vocals, the other three will instead use their voices to imitate the guitars and the bass, with the help of amplifiers, in attempt to sound closer to the original instruments.\n\n\nA Storm to Come is the debut album of German a cappella metal band van Canto, released in 2006. The album cover's artwork was provided by Mattias Noren.\nThe song &quot;The Mission&quot; was released as a single with a music video; the band, however, received more attention with their cover of the Metallica song &quot;Battery.&quot;\n\nThis is my first upload, so sorry if anything goes wrong. Will seed for a long time.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f61c50a58561be0db5f918a8e152766934327bd1","amp;dn":"Van+Canto+-+A+Storm+to+Come","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f61c50a58561be0db5f918a8e152766934327bd1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,28,80,165,133,97,190,13,181,249,24,168,225,82,118,105,52,50,123,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
