We are going to discuss the behaviour of electrons in metals, semiconductors, and dielectrics insulators), and some of the properties of solids affected by this behaviour. We do not pretend this is an exhaustive review of the latest achievements in solid-state physics, but we hope we have described some of the fundamental concepts in the physics of metals, semiconductors, and dielectrics. The book is a supplement to appropriate parts of a physics course in secondary schools and is intended for someone who is finishing secondary school or who has finished it and remembers his school physics. We do not expect a reader to know anything and remembers his school physics. Moreover, sometimes a topic is tackled somewhat differently than it might be treated in school. The mathematics used in the book does not go beyond elementary algebra and the mathematical analysis that should be familiar to anyone finishing secondary school.\n\nThe back cover of the book says:\n\n    The increasingly important field of solid-state physics concerns the behavior of electrons in various crystals. Problems of solid-state physics, which include specific differences between metals and dielectrics and the remarkable properties of semiconductors, are particularly topical in todays `electrnic' society.\n\n    Electrons and Crystals by Dr. Theodore Wolkenstein covers fundamentals of solid state physics in an engaging way. Written in an easy, readable style, the book is intended as a supplement to textbook in secondary school physics courses, and the approach to certain topics in the colume is, therefore, unique. The material is presented in terms of models and required no special additional knowledge.\n\n    Suitable for general reader with a good command of elementary physics and mathematics, this book can also serve as a useful study guide for high-school students.\n\nThe book was translated from the Russian by Michael Burov and was edited by R. N. Hainsworth, first published by Mir in 1985.\n\nThanks Anish.Dot for this book.\n\nPDF | 9.7 MB | OCR | Bookmarked | 600 dpi | Paginated | Cover | Pages: 176\n\n\n======================================\n=++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++=\n=+                                  +=\n=+ Released on TPB by mirtitles.org +=\n=+                                  +=\n=++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++=\n======================================\t\n\nContents:\n\nInstead of Preface: On the Laws of Popular Science 5\n\nIntroduction 11\nI.1.
