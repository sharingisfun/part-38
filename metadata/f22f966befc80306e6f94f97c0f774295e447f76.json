It views the United States relative to other national states, possessing\nlike them (and being possessed by) clearly recognizable nationalist urges or drives. The entire course of American history coincides with the rise of modern nationalism ; and, set in this frame of reference, the American Empire, as its founders so conceived it, provides an excellent introduction to the study of international history.\n\nIn these pages I have tried to convey a sense of direction and unbroken continuity in the history of the United States. The early colonies were no sooner established in the seventeenth century than expansionist impulses began to register in each of them. Imperial patterns took shape, and before the middle of the eighteenth century\nthe concept of an empire that would take in the whole continent was fully formed. A drive south into the Spanish Caribbean was also in progress, with the ultimate goal in view of converting the Caribbean into an American lake. In the Revolution the spirit of conquest was a powerful force, and it took about a century thereafter\nto satisfy the territorial ambitions of the United States. Except for the internal dissension which was a constant factor during the first half of the nineteenth century, and which finally exploded into a civil war of vast proportions, it seems probable that these ambitions would have been pursued more persistently and energetically, that indeed they would have been pushed to the limit. But, by the time of the Mexican War, the controversy between North and South developed into an obsession; and further conquests became for the time being impossible. On the North American continent American expansion reached its maximum limits by 1867, the process of advance having been delayed long enough to enable the Canadians\nto develop the necessary counter-moves. The two related drives,south into the Caribbean and westward to China via Cape Horn, continued to the end of the century, when a burst of energy finished off the process in a war against Spain. From the island conquests of that war the United States emerged a satiated power, so that thereafter American statesmen could truthfully say, with Woodrow\nWilson, that ' never again 'would the United States ' seek one additional foot of territory by conquest '. The sentiment became a fixation, repeated on innumerable occasions, but it is irrelevant.\n\nThe structure of the American Empire thus was completed some sixty years ago; and since my object in this book is to analyze the construction process, I view my task as, in the main, finished with the first decade of the present century. The process of empire-building continues, of course, but thereafter it is more of a problem of consolidation and rendering secure what has been gained. So as to round out the book and emphasize this all-important factor of historical continuity, I have tried in the concluding chapter, to describe, with necessary brevity, this period of consolidation....\n\n\n\nOpinion:\n\nThis book is relevant today as it was when first published in 1960! Why? The U.S. empire remains, although clearly decaying with another (i.e., China? -- not ISIS) on the rise","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f22f966befc80306e6f94f97c0f774295e447f76","amp;dn":"The+Rising+American+Empire+%281974%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f22f966befc80306e6f94f97c0f774295e447f76","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,47,150,107,239,200,3,6,230,249,79,151,192,247,116,41,94,68,127,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
