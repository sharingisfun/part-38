The majorityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½about 140,000 documentsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½are from his years as commander in chief during the Revolutionary War, from 1775 to 1783. This Glorious Struggle presents a selection of WashingtonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most important and interesting letters from that time, including many that have never been published.WashingtonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s lively and often surprisingly candid notes to his wife and family, friends, Congress, fellow soldiersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and even the enemyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½chronicle his most critical tactical and strategic decisions, while offering a rare glimpse of the extremes of depression and exultation into which he was cast by the fortunes of war.\n\nThe letters are arranged chronologically and give a dramatic sense of the major phases of the war, from Boston, Trenton, and Valley Forge, to Monmouth and Yorktown.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab631379f14e64cfe06257d63ecc125c510a70e4","amp;dn":"This+Glorious+Struggle%3A+Washington%5C%27s+Revolutionary+War+Letter","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab631379f14e64cfe06257d63ecc125c510a70e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,99,19,121,241,78,100,207,224,98,87,214,62,204,18,92,81,10,112,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
