Searchable pdf (clearscan) with contents in bookmarks, accurate pagination and metadata, etc.\n\n\nThis was the first anthology I ever read, back when I was a wee thing -- but as a kid I especially loved that cover. Looking over these stories now, I'm astonished they would have been collected and given to children: the opening story begins, for example, by describing how a mother appeared to love her children ... but really didn't love them at all. \n\nBut these are all fine, weird stories. Worth reading, and they stand the test of time.\n\nAuthors include:\n\nD. H. Lawrence, Hortense Calisher, Patricia Highsmith, Brian Aldiss, Idris Seabright, Rudyard Kipling, Shirley Jackson, Jack London, and Jorge Luis Borges","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd4fe55092c439bafeeda493aa41bee899e8fc6e","amp;dn":"Betty+Owen%2C+ed.+-+Nine+Strange+Stories+%28pdf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd4fe55092c439bafeeda493aa41bee899e8fc6e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,79,229,80,146,196,57,186,254,237,164,147,170,65,190,232,153,232,252,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
