IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve learned a lot about them in writing this e-book and hope you do too. Too often, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re confused with specific elements (or features) that can simply be developed as-is from one of the popular Design Pattern and Wireframing Libraries. While those examples are a great start, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re not enough. And although UI design patterns overlap with development patterns - which you can learn more about in A BeginnerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Guide to Design Patterns - theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re focused more on solving common user problems and less on product problems.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c23dac8eac1ab2ce76a65064dceebe6a007c5826","amp;dn":"Bank+Chris+-+Mobile+UI+Design+Patterns+2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c23dac8eac1ab2ce76a65064dceebe6a007c5826","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,61,172,142,172,26,178,206,118,166,80,100,220,238,190,106,0,124,88,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
