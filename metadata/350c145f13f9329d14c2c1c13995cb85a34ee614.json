This book contains case studies highlighting the power of polytope projects for complex problem solving. Any sort of combinational problem characterized by a large variety of possibly complex constructions and deconstructions based on simple building blocks can be studied in a similar way. Although the majority of case studies are related to chemistry, the method is general and equally applicable to other fields for engineering or science.\n\nProduct Details:\n\nPDF: 233 pages\nPublisher: CRC Press; 1 edition (October 15, 2013)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1482204649\nISBN-13: 978-1482204643\nAmazon Link:\n\nContent Details:\n\nimage\n\n------------------------------------------------\nSeed - Share - Enjoy - Give me Thumbs Up\n------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:350c145f13f9329d14c2c1c13995cb85a34ee614","amp;dn":"Polytope+Projects+%282013%29+by+Octavian+Iordache+%5BHxH%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"350c145f13f9329d14c2c1c13995cb85a34ee614","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,12,20,95,19,249,50,157,20,194,193,193,57,149,203,133,163,78,230,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
