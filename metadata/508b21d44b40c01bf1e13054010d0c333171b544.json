It works the entire body, both the right and left sides, in unison. It focuses primarily on what Joseph Pilates called the &quot;powerhouse,&quot; the group of muscles that begins two inches above and below your navel, then wraps completely around your front and back--kind of like a corset. It also includes your buttocks.\n\nThe DVD features the Pilates Beginning Mat Workout, plus a bonus workout and interview with instructor Ana Caban.\n\nVideo; x264; 710*480 (4:3); 2288 kbps; 29.970 fps\nAudio; aac; 160 kbps; 2 ch; 48.0 Khz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:508b21d44b40c01bf1e13054010d0c333171b544","amp;dn":"Pilates+Beginning+Mat+Workout+with+Ana+Caban+x264+aac+%5BMP4%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"508b21d44b40c01bf1e13054010d0c333171b544","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,139,33,212,75,64,192,27,241,225,48,84,1,13,12,51,49,113,181,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
