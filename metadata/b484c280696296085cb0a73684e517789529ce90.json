It's also about how to throw a challenge to your lot. How to deceive or bribe your destiny.\nStefek and his older sister Elka are the main characters of this film - and from what the opening line states (the director dedicates the film to his older sister) its possible that the film is 'semi-autobiographical'.\nTheir relationship almost borders on mother and son as Elka says to Steffek, she is 'both Mom and Dad' to him, and that is what the movie mostly revolves around ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the antics of young Steffek and how Elka does her best to watch out for him, and balance that job with the one she has at a restaurant and another job that she is desperately trying to win in a big firm in that small town. Steffek, meanwhile is someone who totally believes in fortune and how one could get lucky in different ways, like, by throwing coins on the railway tracks and keeping his fingers crossed for hours as Elka waits in queue for her interview.\nThere are other quite important characters in this film too, like the man who Steffek believes is his father and Elka's boyfriend apart from some minor roles played by their mother, neighbor and a few others. All in all, it's a very simple film and Jakimowski keeps the storyline pretty straightforward. That is the secret to the beauty of this film ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ its simplicity. It's also quite funny at times and it opens a window into Polish small-town life, and it kind of made want to visit this town - If I could find it, and if I were living not too far from there, I would - if it meant just spending a lazy weekend there, taking a stroll, a swim or just sipping some coffee and watching the trains go by.\n\nDVD5 with extras.\n\nSize: 4.36 Gb ( 4 566 816 KBytes ) - DVD-5\nEnabled regions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\nPlay Length: 01:31:45\nVideo: PAL 16:9 (720x576) VBR, Auto Letterboxed\nAudio: Polish (Dolby AC3, 6 ch)\nSubtitles: English, Polish\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b484c280696296085cb0a73684e517789529ce90","amp;dn":"Sztuczki+%282007%29+aka+Tricks+Poland+DVDR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b484c280696296085cb0a73684e517789529ce90","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,132,194,128,105,98,150,8,92,176,167,54,132,229,23,120,149,41,206,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
