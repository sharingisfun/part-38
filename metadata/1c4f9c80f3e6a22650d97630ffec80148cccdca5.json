Different data files are also synchronized together.\n\nSharing findings and information between different groups is easier than ever before, with Trace Analyzer documentation function. You can document your findings into analysis, and all findings are tied to a time stamp, so it will be seen in specific row of data view.\n\nAutomating routine work!
