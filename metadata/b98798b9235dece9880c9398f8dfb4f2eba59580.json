Some of the deleted scenes, alternate takes and behind the scene footage are now back in the movie. New music. New special effects. Key scenes have been reorganized.\n\n\n\nIntention:\n\nTo complete a Ã¢â‚¬Å“grindhouse double featureÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ I needed a second movie. (The first is JAWS: The Sharksploitation Edit, now The War Of The Stars: A New Hope Grindhoused.) When you talk about Ã¢â‚¬Å“grindhouse double featureÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Planet Terror/Death Proof comes to mind, and what people usualy says?Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Damn, Planet Terror was fun, but Death Proof was a bore!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nPersonally I like Death Proof a lot but I can understand why people felt it was boring. I hope this edit will not bore you too much! I took as an advice a comment on my JAWS edit who said it was Ã¢â‚¬Å“too long for mockeryÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ so I made the overall length quite short this time.\n\nI want to thanks Puggo for letting me use his 16mm preservation work, known as The Puggo Grande. I just zoomed and cropped it for it to have a more Ã¢â‚¬Å“Star WarsishÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ aspect ratio. (So the picture quality of the Puggo Grande is better, I wanted to point out that fact.) Only I think that quality loss helped me a lot to blend some documentary footage back in the movie.\n\nAnd THAT is one of the main purpose of this edit: to bring back a lot of deleted scenes and various footage. Does it make it a better movie? Hell no. This is a cheap version of Star Wars. Hopefully fun for the fans to watch.\n\n\n\nOther Sources:\n\n- Main source is the 16mm print restoration of the 1977 cut (this original cut is available in the 2006 DVD release of this movie).\n- A countless of other sources (alternate shots, deleted scenes, behind the scene footages, fan films..), mainly available in the Bluray release of the original trilogy.\n\n- New music: Isao Tomita (Mars the Bringer of War and Aranjuez), Judas Priest (Peace), Neil Young (Twilight, live), Lalo Shiffrin (Free Ide and Days Of Wine And Roses), SPOCK (The Force Of Life), Carrie Fisher (Happy Life Day), The Great Luke Ski (Star Wars Homesick Blues)\n\n\n\nEditing Details:\n\nToo much to list. See the overall description, but be prepared for major twists and changes.\n\n\nSpecial Thanks:\n\nTo everyone at originaltrilogy.com and to Doubleofive who came with the idea of R2D2Ã¢â‚¬Â²s subtitles.\n\n\nScreenshots:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/U4B8JFl.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/U4B8JFl.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/dalVPoM.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/dalVPoM.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/H9u4ngI.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/H9u4ngI.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\nCover Art:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/qnn11zo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/qnn11zo.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/8B31YB3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/8B31YB3.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/AfJB980.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/AfJB980.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/MgFhSDp.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/MgFhSDp.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b98798b9235dece9880c9398f8dfb4f2eba59580","amp;dn":"War+Of+The+Stars+-+A+New+Hope+Gridnhoused+by+TMBTM+%28FanEdit%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b98798b9235dece9880c9398f8dfb4f2eba59580","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,135,152,185,35,93,236,233,136,12,147,152,248,223,180,242,235,165,149,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
