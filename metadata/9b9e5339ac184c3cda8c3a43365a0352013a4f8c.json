While hoping to keep a lid on this news and his paper going, Earl unexpectedly finds a brand -new &quot;Viola&quot; column on his desk. Earl, his Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Bellport HeraldÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ staffers Brian (Adamo Ruggiero) and Peggy (Sheila McCarthy), and soon the entire town find ViolaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s new published tone to be refreshing, no -nonsense, funny and wise. An outpouring of mail for Viola floods in. Again, Earl leaves the mail on his desk and another column appears.\n\n Using the security camera, Earl discovers the mystery columnist to be none other than Katie Miner (Kellie Martin), the shy accountant who has quietly done the books at the paper for years. Katie agrees to continue writing the column as long as her identity can remain secret. Sifting through a mountain of letters, Katie becomes struck by one from a widower, Russ (Jefferson Brown), who calls himself &quot;Mr. Lost Love.&quot; Working as a deep sea fisherman with pal Clay Jackson (Arnold Pinnock), Russ canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t seem to move past the loss of his wife five years prior and struggles to find the strength to raise his young daughter, Meredith (Kira Gelineau). Firmly, Katie encourages him to reach out to others, begin dating and start living. As they correspond through the column and run into each other (hidden by their pen names), Katie starts to fall for Russ. But when Russ decides to take ViolaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s advice and start dating the knockout new girl in town, Jamie (Brittany Gray), Katie has to decide if itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s really in her best interest to keep her identity and growing feelings secret.\n\n\nCast: \n\nRobinne Fanfair ...
