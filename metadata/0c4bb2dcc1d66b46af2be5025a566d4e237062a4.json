Mike J cut 38 minutes out of AOTC to create this version. An excellent follow up to The Phantom Edit.\n\nHere's a link to a TFN review: http://www.theforce.net/rouser/reviews/phantom_attack.asp\n\nRipped from DVD image.\n\nDownload that image here:\nPlay that image with VLC:\nwww.videolan.org\n\nAgain, this torrent is just the movie.  Thefile is for the DVD image, which you can either burn and watch on your player, or just play off your computer with VLC.  It's much bigger, but it's worth it for the commentary track.\n\nThanks Mike J!\n\nNow, if we could only get Revenge of the Phantom...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c4bb2dcc1d66b46af2be5025a566d4e237062a4","amp;dn":"Star+Wars+Episode+II%3A+Attack+of+The+Phantom","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c4bb2dcc1d66b46af2be5025a566d4e237062a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,75,178,220,193,214,107,70,175,43,229,2,90,86,109,78,35,112,98,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
