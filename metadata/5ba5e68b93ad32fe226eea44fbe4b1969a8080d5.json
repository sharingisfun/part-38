These people are celebrities now. What was it like when they were just a couple friends with an idea? Founders like Steve Wozniak (Apple), Caterina Fake (Flickr), Mitch Kapor (Lotus), Max Levchin (PayPal), and Sabeer Bhatia (Hotmail) tell you in their own words about their surprising and often very funny discoveries as they learned how to build a company.\n\nWhere did they get the ideas that made them rich? How did they convince investors to back them? What went wrong, and how did they recover?\n\nNearly all technical people have thought of one day starting or working for a startup. For them, this book is the closest you can come to being a fly on the wall at a successful startup, to learn how it's done.\n\nBut ultimately these interviews are required reading for anyone who wants to understand business, because startups are business reduced to its essence. The reason their founders become rich is that startups do what businesses doÃ¢â‚¬â€create valueÃ¢â‚¬â€more intensively than almost any other part of the economy. How? What are the secrets that make successful startups so insanely productive? Read this book, and let the founders themselves tell you.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ba5e68b93ad32fe226eea44fbe4b1969a8080d5","amp;dn":"Founders+At+Work+-+Stories+of+Startups%27+Early+Days+-+Jessica+Liv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ba5e68b93ad32fe226eea44fbe4b1969a8080d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,165,230,139,147,173,50,254,34,110,234,68,251,228,177,150,154,128,128,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
