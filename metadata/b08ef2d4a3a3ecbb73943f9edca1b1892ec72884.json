Based on The Day after Roswell by Lt. Col. Philip J. Corso and William Birnes, we explore if technologies like the laser, fiber optics, the integrated circuit, super-strong fibers, and night vision were developed with the aid of aliens. Career officer Corso claims his first alien encounter came on July 6, `47, while on late-night security rounds at Ft. Riley, Kansas, where he saw bodies of EBEs (extraterrestrial biological entities) inside shipping crates. In 1961, as Chief of Foreign Technology in the Army's department of Research and Development, his job included analyzing alien technology from Roswell, then introducing it into America's technological mainstream--thus, reverse-engineering alien artifacts.  And we talk to many scientists involved at the time, who credit hard work, not alien contact, with these technological advances. cc","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b08ef2d4a3a3ecbb73943f9edca1b1892ec72884","amp;dn":"%5BHistory+Channel%5D+UFO+Files+-+The+Day+After+Roswell.mpg","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b08ef2d4a3a3ecbb73943f9edca1b1892ec72884","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,142,242,212,163,163,236,187,115,148,63,158,220,161,177,137,46,199,40,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
