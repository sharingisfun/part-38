Maybe science will have something to say about that. But I do know people can learn to &quot;talk&quot; to animals, and to hear what animals have to say, better than they do now. --From Animals in Translation\n\nWhy would a cow lick a tractor? Why are collies getting dumber? Why do dolphins sometimes kill for fun? How can a parrot learn to spell? How did wolves teach man to evolve? Temple Grandin draws upon a long, distinguished career as an animal scientist and her own experiences with autism to deliver an extraordinary message about how animals act, think, and feel. She has a perspective like that of no other expert in the field, which allows her to offer unparalleled observations and groundbreaking ideas. \n\nPeople with autism can often think the way animals think, putting them in the perfect position to translate &quot;animal talk.&quot; Grandin is a faithful guide into their world, exploring animal pain, fear, aggression, love, friendship, communication, learning, and, yes, even animal genius. The sweep of Animals in Translation is immense and will forever change the way we think about animals. \n\n\n*includes a Behavior and Training Troubleshooting Guide\n \nAmong its provocative ideas, the book: \n\nargues that language is not a requirement for consciousness--and that animals do have consciousness \napplies the autism theory of &quot;hyper-specificity&quot; to animals, showing that animals and autistic people are so sensitive to detail that they &quot;can't see the forest for the trees&quot;--a talent as well as a &quot;deficit&quot; \nexplores the &quot;interpreter&quot; in the normal human brain that filters out detail, leaving people blind to much of the reality that surrounds them--a reality animals and autistic people see, sometimes all too clearly\nexplains how animals have &quot;superhuman&quot; skills: animals have animal genius\ncompares animals to autistic savants, declaring that animals may in fact be autistic savants, with special forms of genius that normal people do not possess and sometimes cannot even see \nexamines how humans and animals use their emotions to think, to decide, and even to predict the future \nreveals the remarkable abilities of handicapped people and animals \nmaintains that the single worst thing you can do to an animal is to make it feel afraid\n\n--\nHow is Animals in Translation different from every other animal book ever published?Animals in Translation is like no other animal book because of Temple Grandin. As an animal scientist and a person with autism, her professional training and personal history have created a perspective like no other thinker in the field, and this is her exciting, groundbreaking view of the intersection of autism and animal. \nUnlike other well-known writers in the field of animal behavior -- When Elephants Weep by psychoanalyst Jeffrey Moussaleff Masson, How Dogs Think by psychologist and dog trainer Stanley Coren, and The Hidden Life of Dogs by anthropologist Elizabeth Marsha Thomas -- Temple Grandin is an animal scientist who has devoted the last 30 years of her life to the study of animals. Animals in Translation is the culmination of that life's work -- a book whose sweep is huge, including just about anything that gallops, trots, slithers, walks, or flies. \nTemple Grandin is like no other author on the subject of animals because of her training and because of her autism; understanding animals is in her blood and her bones. \nAnimals in Translation ... \n* redefines consciousness and argues that language is not a requirement for consciousness \n* categorizes autism as a way station on the road from animals to humans \n* explores the &quot;Interpreter&quot; in the normal human brain that filters out detail, creating an unintentional blindness that animals and autistics do not suffer from \n* applies the autism theory of &quot;hyper-specificity' to animals, meaning that there is no forest, only trees, trees, and more trees \n* argues that the single worst thing you cando to an animal is make it feel afraid \n* examines how humans and animals use their emotions, including to predict the future \n* compares animals to autistic savants, in fact declaring that animals may be autistic savants, with special forms of genius that normal people cannot see \n* explains that most animals have &quot;super-human&quot; skills: animals have animal genius \n* reveals the abilities handicapped people, and animals, have that normal people don't\n\n\n\nI don't know if people will ever be able to talk to animals the way Doctor Doolittle could, or whether animals will be able to talk back. Maybe science will have something to say about that.
