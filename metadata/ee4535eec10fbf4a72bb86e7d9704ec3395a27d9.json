Probably the most fondly remembered        \n  sketch show of the 1990s  famed for catchphrases such as Suit you,  \n  sir!, Scorchio! and Does my bum look big in this?  is back      \n  today.                                                                \n                                                                        \n  This time, though, it isnt on BBC Two. Like Alan Partridges Mid     \n  Morning Matters and Vic &amp; Bobs Afternoon Delights, its showing on   \n  the website of Fosters, the lager company that has decided to help   \n  flog its wares by funding the online-only comebacks of hit comedies.  \n  The whole cast has returned, except Mark Williams (You aint seen    \n  me, right?, Ill get me coat); Higson says he was keen initially  \n  but was doing other stuff that clashed. Still, they are rejoined by  \n  Caroline Aherne, who left in 1997 to make The Royle Family.           \n                                                                        \n  EPISODE SYNOPSIS:                                                     \n                                                                        \n  Watch Episode Six as Ted and Ralph, Billy Bleach, Ron Manager and     \n  team, as well as more of your favourite characters from the cult TV   \n  comedy sketch show make a long awaited return                         \n                                                                        \n  NOTES:                                                                \n                                                                        \n  Being aired on fostersfunny.co.uk - geoblocked to all you             \n  non-Britains out there - W4F brings you the full new series 4 of The  \n  Fast Show. For US friends this series was called &quot;Brilliant&quot; in the   \n  US to avoid confusion with a similarly named show!                    \n                                                                        \n  XviD rules state ripper discretion for filesize for less than 14      \n  minute shows, so sized these rips at 100MB for good quality and to    \n  be consistent throughout the series (in case of later episodes being  \n  longer).                                                              \n                                                                        \n  SOURCE NOTES:                                                         \n                                                                        \n  The source is obviously WEBRip, since this is the only media          \n  platform this is being shown on.
