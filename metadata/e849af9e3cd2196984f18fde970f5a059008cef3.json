She and two of her friends are trapped in a department store with an elf, and only Dan Haggerty, as the renegade loose-cannon Santa Claus, can save them.\n\nI cannot say enough about this movie. It is definitely in my top 3 best/worst movies ever. This movie will make you cry with laughter.\n\nMy intent here is to try to ul the torrents that I haven't been able to find on tpb. I will seed until there are a sufficient amount of seeders. Any constructive criticism will be received. Looking forward to sharing some rarities.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099496/?ref_=fn_al_tt_2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099496/?ref_=fn_al_tt_2&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e849af9e3cd2196984f18fde970f5a059008cef3","amp;dn":"Elves+1989+%5B.flv%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e849af9e3cd2196984f18fde970f5a059008cef3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,73,175,158,60,210,25,105,132,241,143,222,151,15,90,5,144,8,206,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
