Mann has always considered the late pianist Bill Evans to be one of his favorite musicians and he actually recorded an album with him (1961's Nirvana). For his Kokopelli release, Mann performs eight songs composed by Evans and one (&quot;Blue in Green&quot;) that the pianist claimed Miles Davis permanently &quot;borrowed&quot; from him. Mann wisely did not utilize a piano (thereby avoiding any comparisons) and his thoughtful set has more variety than one might expect. Randy Brecker has a couple of guest spots on flugelhorn, Mann overdubbed additional flutes on a few numbers (forming a section behind his solo playing) and he used an excellent and quiet rhythm section comprised of guitarist Bruce Dunlap, bassist Eddie Gomez, drummer Louis Nash, and sometimes percussionist Sammy Figueroa. A few of the pieces are heated while others are quite introspective but all of the music is both thoughtful and swinging. Highly recommended. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f54b7581d529045f272ca9823d6b9b9d0b116aa","amp;dn":"Herbie+Mann+-+Peace+Pieces_The++Music+of+Bill+Evans+%281995%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f54b7581d529045f272ca9823d6b9b9d0b116aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,84,183,88,29,82,144,69,242,114,202,152,35,214,185,185,208,177,22,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
