One bird stands out amongst the flock ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Bill. Well-liked, but seldom understood, Bill waddles to a different beat. He is a quirky, smaller than average duck with a big imagination and a secret fun loving side. BillÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s best friend is Aldo, from the neighbouring town of Swampwood. A big lumbering bull-in-a-china-shop alligator, chock-full of rough edges. Aldo is also a tough guy with a soft centre. This unlikely friendship between these two creatures on opposite ends of the food chain sets the scene for unique challenges... and a lot of fun.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ebc5b15ca880440660789c347f150acb97188db8","amp;dn":"Sitting+Ducks+%5BPC%5D+%5BMULTI2%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ebc5b15ca880440660789c347f150acb97188db8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,197,177,92,168,128,68,6,96,120,156,52,127,21,10,203,151,24,141,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
