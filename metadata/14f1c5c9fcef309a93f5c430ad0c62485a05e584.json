He decides to make one final piece of art: he will capture a dying breath in a jar and exhibit it.\n\nBen invites freelance radio producer Anita Sullivan to profile him and document the process of capturing The Last Breath. But as the date for breath capture approaches, the identity of the donor remains a mystery.\n\nNicky is played by Nicola Walker\n\nThe interviewees are;\nDerek and Mo Fearnside, Ben Fletcher, Professor Emma Jones, Anthony Chopper White, Linda Keenan and Dr Mark Gretason.\n\nThe Static State artists are;\nKenny Watson, Alex Allan, Joseph Watts and Robert Perry.\n\nMusic was written and performed by Nick Tettersell.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14f1c5c9fcef309a93f5c430ad0c62485a05e584","amp;dn":"Ben+Fearnside+and+Anita+Sullivan+-+The+Last+Breath+%28BBC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14f1c5c9fcef309a93f5c430ad0c62485a05e584","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,241,197,201,252,239,48,154,147,245,196,48,173,12,98,72,90,5,229,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
