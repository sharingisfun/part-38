That's\n   pretty much all you need to know about this twelve, read much further\n   into this review and you stand every chance of missing out on bagging\n   what is already the most hyped-up and in-demand 12&quot; of the year so far.\n   But what does it sound like? Well, very good indeed is the quick answer.\n   'Wolf Cub' actually sounds pretty much exactly as you would imagine a\n   Four Tet/Burial hook-up to sound, merging Kieran Hebden's refined\n   Gamelan style sculptures with crushing woodblock percussion that would\n   sound like an incorrigible Burial ripoff until you remember that, err,\n   it is Burial! Sick sick tune. Over on the flipside things get a little\n   stranger, with &quot;Moth&quot; delivering a kind of dour 4/4 variation that\n   actually sounds like neither artist, making use of squashed club sounds\n   with an almost claustrophobic feel. Alien, brilliant music unlike\n   anything else you'll hear this year - hurry or there'll be tears!\n   Essential Purchase.\n\n   Note: not a brilliant pressing and the b side in particular has more\n   surface noise than usual. I cleaned it up as best I could without\n   affecting the sound quality.\n\n  .\n\n   01          Wolf Cub                                              09:01\n   02          Moth                                                  09:03\n                                                                     .   .\n                                                                     18:04 min\n  .","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:acb1e2e4924cd3bddaa2627029ca00808dc3d9ac","amp;dn":"Burial_and_Four_Tet-Wolf_Cub_and_Moth-%28TEXT06%29-Vinyl-2009-MAEM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"acb1e2e4924cd3bddaa2627029ca00808dc3d9ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,177,226,228,146,76,211,189,218,162,98,112,41,202,0,128,141,195,217,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
