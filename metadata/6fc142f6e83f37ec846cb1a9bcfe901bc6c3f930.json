The Austin four got together in 1994 and wasted no time in blanketing the country and cranking out 7&quot;s, initially hooking with the label of tourmates Christy Front Drive, The Audio Concept, and Caulfield Records. A zine editor in Colorado, impressed with Mineral's groundbreaking blend of power and emotion, sent a 7&quot; to the chief of fledgling Crank! Records, Jeff Matlow. The band received repeated phone calls that day from Matlow, and thus began a marriage that would launch both label and band into underground fame. Mineral's first full-length, The Power of Failing, was a powerful success and inspired a rabid following among scenesters. The young band's grasp of dynamics and thoughtful lyrics about coming of age also influenced indie rock bands everywhere, as their sound still permeates across the underground. End Serenading turned out to be the end for Mineral, which had agreed to do its next record with Interscope, a record that never happened. Still only in their early twenties, bandmembers moved onto new projects: singer/guitarist Chris Simpson and bassist Jeremy Gomez began the Gloria Record and drummer Gabe Wiley joined Pop Unknown.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6fc142f6e83f37ec846cb1a9bcfe901bc6c3f930","amp;dn":"Mineral+-+The+Complete+Collection+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6fc142f6e83f37ec846cb1a9bcfe901bc6c3f930","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,193,66,246,232,63,55,236,132,108,177,169,188,254,144,27,198,195,249,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
