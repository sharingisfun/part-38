Of the latter, &quot;Harmageddon&quot; is probably the standout track, and while most Metalli-fans will be eager to hear the group's rendition of the smash hit &quot;One,&quot; the song takes a backseat to inspired renditions of earlier classics such as &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot; and &quot;Fade to Black.&quot; As for the other bands covered, the arrangements of Pantera's &quot;Domination&quot; and Sepultura's &quot;Refuse/Resist&quot; are rather dull, but Faith No More's &quot;From Out of Nowhere&quot; works surprisingly well, and the group's performance of the album's incredibly complex title track (another Sepultura original) is simply stunning.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:282595b0b5f7d7cb35399781b0a88941cada9081","amp;dn":"Apocalyptica+-+1998+Inquisition+Symphony","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"282595b0b5f7d7cb35399781b0a88941cada9081","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,37,149,176,181,247,215,203,53,57,151,129,176,168,137,65,202,218,144,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
