Leaders are not needed when there is no country.\n\nThis is a purely selfish activity. That leaders would care so little about their own people, that they would provide for their own safety, and allow millions, or billions, of their own people to be killed.\n\nIf there is no country left, then these useless leaders are not needed anyhow. There is no country to rule over. If they hide, they are not Ã¢â‚¬Å“leading.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nHiding in a hole in the ground, leaving others in danger, is an act of cowardice.\n\n\nBible Prophecy of end times, and D.U.M.B.S:\n\n   Rev 6:14   And the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together; and every mountain and island were moved out of their places.\n\n   Rev 6:15   And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every bondman, and every free man, hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains;\n\n   Rev 6:16   And said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb:\n\n   Rev 6:17   For the great day of his wrath is come; and who shall be able to stand?\n\nFor those who are unaware of what D.U.M.B.s are, they are Deep Underground Military Bases:\n\nA final war is coming.\n\nBut that is not all that is coming.\n\nLeaders will pay with their lives for how they have cheated their people, in order to pamper themselves.\n\nNatural disasters will be sent by God during an upcoming time of Wrath, and the disasters will find the leaders, wherever they are hiding.\n\nThe D.U.M.B.s will become underground graveyards.\n\nThey will be underwater tombs, as tsunamis flow over their hiding places.\n\nIf not tsunamis, then earthquakes so huge will break open, or crush, their hiding places.\n\nAnyone who hides underground will be destroyed.\n\nLeaders have wasted all this money on a useless effort, when they could have been caring for their people.\n\nTrue leaders are servants. And true servants give of themselves to protect those they serve.\n\nMaybe if they had cared for their own country more, and their people, God would have spared their lives.\n\nDeceived, godless leaders have fellowshipped with aliens, who present themselves as friendly.\n\nThey see salvation in strange creatures, but not God.\n\nThey have provided admission points for these aliens in the D.U.M.B.S, even though the average citizen cannot get in.\n\nThe leaders may find later that the friendly aliens, that they thought were friendly, will be having them for lunch, 600 feet underground, as they try to save themselves.\n\nSo, between tsunamis, earthquakes, other floods, that will destroy the D.U.M.B.s, and aliens that will turn on them, these cowardly, foolish leaders are in big trouble.\n\nIf they really want salvation from destruction, they need to repent of their sins, and give their hearts to Jesus Christ, Yeshua, Ha Moshiach.\n\nThis is in memory of my Mom who passed at 11:44 pm PST ON 1-25-2011. Now she knows.\n\nJESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.\n\nBorn of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:789e9554292c34b9e6442d8e133f7e9e682d77e0","amp;dn":"POtHS+-+DUMB+-+Deep+Underground+Military+Bases+and+Cities+-+Vol+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"789e9554292c34b9e6442d8e133f7e9e682d77e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,158,149,84,41,44,52,185,230,68,45,142,19,63,126,158,104,45,119,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
