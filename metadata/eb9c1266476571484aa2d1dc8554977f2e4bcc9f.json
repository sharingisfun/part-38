As a member of the group, Banks has been a pioneer in the use of a variety of keyboards, such the ARP Pro Soloist synthesiser, the Mellotron, the Yamaha CP-70 and the Hammond T-102 organ. Through most of the band's history, Banks was the leading force in Genesis' songwriting; although the group was often responsible as a whole for composing songs, his ideas were often the nucleus of their music, and he would frequently write lyrics as well.
