Not to mention a free soundtrack album, videos, and other stuff?\n\nAnd does the book really contain the whole story thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s in the commercial version of the book? Seriously, whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s going on?\n\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s simple.\n\nFirst, yes, the Official Hipper Tiger Torrent has the full, complete story thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s in the commercial version of the novel. And itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s coming to you straight from the publisher, so itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not only free, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also legal.\n\nSecond, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re confident that youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll love &quot;Luck + Death at the Edge of the World.&quot; So once you get your free copy, you might want to buy a commercial copy. You donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have to -- you can stick with the free version if you prefer -- but the commercial edition has a lot of bonus material that explores the factual background behind the fictional story.\n\nWant to know about the real world of military robot dogs or the uploading of human minds? Curious about who the real Alan Turing was? And whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s up with all those crazy diseases? The bonus section covers all this and more.\n\nThird, the soundtrack album has always been free -- we love giving our readers kickass freebies -- but until now it hasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t been available through torrent sites. Distributing it this way will get it out to a whole bunch of new listeners. It includes fourteen tracks by artists in eight countries, including indie musicians, a film composer, a classical composer, and (of course) the author.\n\nSo enjoy! And be sure to check the download for instructions on how to get a free bonus book, too!\n\nHave a comment or question about this free bundle?
