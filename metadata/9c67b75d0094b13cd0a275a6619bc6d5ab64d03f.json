On the other side live the Zooks, which (gasp!) butter their bread \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;butter side down\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;. The two groups, whom appear to be the exact same with the exception of this one characteristic, have waged war with each other for countless years. \n\nThe Butter Battle Book shows the story of an old man who was once patrolled the wall, protecting the Yooks from the terror of the Zooks. With the help of his advisor, things get worse and worse until he and Zooks\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' protector both bring out a device that will destroy both sides of the wall forever. Who\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s going to drop it first? We may never know...\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0213536/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0213536/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFile Name:............Dr.Seuss.The Butter.Battle.Book.avi\nRuntime:..............23mn 35s\nFilesize:.............300 MiB\n\nLanguage:.............English\nSubtitles:............None\n\nVideo codec:..........MPEG-4 Visual XVID\nVideo aspect ratio:...4:3\nVideo width x height:.640x480\nVideo framerate:......29.970\nVideo bitrate:........1,642 Kbps\n\nAudio type:...........MPEG Audio MP3\nAudio channels:.......2 Ch\nAudio sample rate:....48.0 Khz\nAudio bitrate:........128 Kbps\n\n*Note: Old VHS Tape.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c67b75d0094b13cd0a275a6619bc6d5ab64d03f","amp;dn":"Dr.+Seuss%5C%27s+The+Butter+Battle+Book+%28with+no+interlacing+artefac","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c67b75d0094b13cd0a275a6619bc6d5ab64d03f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,103,183,93,0,148,177,60,208,162,117,166,97,155,198,213,171,100,208,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
