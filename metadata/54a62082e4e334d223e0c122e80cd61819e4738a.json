It was written and produced by BeyoncÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Knowles, Sam Barnes, Jean-Claude Olivier and Cory Rooney for the group's third studio album, Survivor (2001), although the song first appeared on the soundtrack to the 2000 film adaption of Charlie's Angels. It is also the first single with Michelle Williams on vocals. Originally, part two of the song was the actual song and part one was known as the Pasadena remix, but it was chosen in favor of the original and was dubbed part one. Released as both the soundtrack's and album's leading single in fall 2000, the song held the number one spot on the Billboard Hot 100 chart for eleven consecutive weeks from November 2000 to February 2001. Later it was named the 18th most successful song of the 2000s, on the Billboard Hot 100 Songs of the Decade. Although, for the United Kingdom, it was released on the same day, with both Part I and Part II counting as the song release. The music video was directed by Francis Lawrence. At the end, the women are greeted by the ever-mysterious &quot;Charlie&quot;.\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Independent Women Part 1 (Album Version)\n[02] Independent Women Part 1 (Victor Calderone Radio Mix)\n[03] Independent Women Part 1 (Maurice's Radio Mix)\n \nTotal Mp3 Play Time\t&gt; 00h:12m:03s\nTotal File Size\t&gt; 29.8mb (Including MP3s, Art Covers &amp; File)\nTotal Bit Size\t&gt; 320kbps\nMusic File Type\t&gt; I-Tunes v.9.0.0.70 MP3 Format\nMusic Video Format\t&gt; N / A\nScanned Artwork\t&gt; Yes @ 300dpi\nOriginal CD Rip\t&gt; Yes - only1joe\nOriginal Uploader\t&gt; Yes - only1joe \nUpload Speed\t&gt; 33-35KB/s\nMusic Genre\t&gt; R&amp;B Pop\nRelease Date\t&gt; 31 October 2000   20 November 2000   13 February 2001  \nRecord Company\t&gt; \nArtists WebSite\t&gt; \n\n&gt;[Independent Women Part 1]\n\n=====================================================\n\nIndependent Women Part II - Destinys Child [2000]\n\t\n[img]http://img718.imageshack.us/img718/2477/independentwomenpartide.jpg[/img] &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/iakJbAaCh&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/iakJbAaCh&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Independent Women Part II\n[02] Say My Name (Remix)\n[03] So Good\n \nTotal Mp3 Play Time\t&gt; 00h:12m:02s\nTotal File Size\t&gt; 32.3mb (Including MP3s, Art Covers &amp; File)\nTotal Bit Size\t&gt; 320kbps\nMusic File Type\t&gt; I-Tunes v.9.0.0.70 MP3 Format\nMusic Video Format\t&gt; N / A\nScanned Artwork\t&gt; Yes @ 300dpi\nOriginal CD Rip\t&gt; Yes - only1joe\nOriginal Uploader\t&gt; Yes - only1joe \nUpload Speed\t&gt; 33-35KB/s\nMusic Genre\t&gt; R&amp;B Pop\nRelease Date\t&gt; 31 October  2000   20 November 2000   13 February 2001  \nRecord Company\t&gt; Sony Music\nArtists WebSite\t&gt; \n\n&gt;--&gt; couldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t find a video for this one.\n\n=====================================================\n\nJumpin' Jumpin' [CDS] - Destinys Child [2000]\n\t\n[img]http://img641.imageshack.us/img641/5716/jumpinjumpincdsdestinys.jpg[/img] &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/kakJJaAch&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/kakJJaAch&lt;/a&gt; \n\nWikipedia - &quot;Jumpin', Jumpin'&quot; is 2000 R&amp;B hit song by American girl group Destiny's Child.
