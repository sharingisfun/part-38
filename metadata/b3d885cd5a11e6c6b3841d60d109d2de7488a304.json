Though the two nations share considerable cultural and economic connections, their film industries remain distinct, marked by differences of scale, level of government involvement and funding, and relations with other countries and national cinemas. Through essays about prominent genres and themes, profiles of directors, and comprehensive reviews of significant titles, this user-friendly guide explores the diversity and distinctiveness of films from Australia and New Zealand from Whale Rider to The Piano to Wolf Creek.\n\nPublisher: Intellect Ltd (December 15, 2010)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1841503738\nISBN-13: 978-1841503738\n\nEditorial Reviews\nAbout the Author\n\nBen Goldsmith is a senior researcher at the Australian Film, Television, and Radio School and a research fellow at the University of Queensland.
