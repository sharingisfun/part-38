It has a spiritual and romantic dimension, different from some of the other albums which have a stronger political slant. The Mighty Atlantic is great, and very well-known. Other songs like Road and the River (simply stunning), The Wedding and The Dancing Floor are just superb. And the album ends with the outstanding Lighthouse, which almost has a gospel-like quality. All this incredible songwriting, with the fantastic music, and of course the voice of Donnie. If you like Runrig, you will love this CD.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b6ae5b19bb5f81c95c4198d49fe0f43f5b65652a","amp;dn":"Runrig++-+Mara+%5B1995%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b6ae5b19bb5f81c95c4198d49fe0f43f5b65652a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,174,91,25,187,95,129,201,92,65,152,212,159,224,244,63,91,101,101,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
