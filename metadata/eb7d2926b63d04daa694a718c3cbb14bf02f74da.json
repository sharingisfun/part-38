His dissatisfaction, combined with his frequent business trips through several time zones, is mentally taxing enough that he develops severe insomnia.\n\nAt his doctor's recommendation (who thinks insomnia is not a serious ailment), the narrator attends a support group for men suffering from testicular cancer, to &quot;see what real suffering is like&quot;. He finds that crying and listening to the emotional problems of suffering people is an emotional release and is able to sleep again, but becomes dependent on attending these meetings. Although not dying like the others, he is never caught being a &quot;tourist&quot; until meeting Marla Singer, a woman who attends the support groups as well. She reflects the narrator's &quot;tourism&quot;, reminding him that he is a faker and does not belong there. He begins to hate Marla for keeping him from crying, and, therefore, from sleeping. After a confrontation, they agree to attend separate support group meetings to avoid each other.\n\nShortly after this incident, his life changes radically on meeting Tyler Durden, a charismatic psychopath who works low-paying night jobs in order to perform deviant behaviour on the job. After his confrontation with Marla, an explosion destroys the narrator's condominium apartment; he asks Tyler if he can stay at his house. Tyler agrees, but asks for something in return: &quot;I want you to hit me as hard as you can&quot;.[10] Their fight, in a bar's parking lot, attract local, socially disenchanted men; &quot;Fight Club&quot;, a new form of psychological support group is born, mental therapy via bare-knuckle fighting, set to rules:\n\n       1. You don't talk about fight club.\n       2. You don't talk about fight club.[11]\n       3. When someone says stop, or goes limp, even if he's just faking it, the fight is over.[12]\n       4. Only two guys to a fight.\n       5. One fight at a time.\n       6. They fight without shirts or shoes.\n       7. The fights go on as long as they have to.\n       8. If this is your first night at fight club, you have to fight.\n\n    ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Fight Club, pages 48ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“50[13]\n\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n=EBOOK=\nFormat: PDF\nAuthor: Chuck Palahniuk\nTitle: Fight Club\nGenre: Satirical novel\nSize: 561 KB\nISBN 978-1-4361-4960-0\n\n=AUDIO BOOK=\nAudio Codec: mp3\nRead by James Colby\nAuthor: Chuck Palahniuk\nTItle: Fight Club unabridged\nBitrate: 40 kbps\nLength: 05:34:40\n\n\nEnjoy!\n\n_Uber\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb7d2926b63d04daa694a718c3cbb14bf02f74da","amp;dn":"PDF.MP3.Chuck+Palahniuk+-+Fight+Club+%5BUber%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb7d2926b63d04daa694a718c3cbb14bf02f74da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,125,41,38,182,61,4,218,166,148,167,24,195,203,177,75,240,47,116,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
