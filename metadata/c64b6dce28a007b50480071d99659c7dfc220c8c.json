Unable to think clearly, or work, or even get out of bed, she became anxious and depressed, even suicidalÃ¢â‚¬â€a common symptom for concussion sufferers. But rather than let herself sink further, she decided to get better by doing what she does best: she turned her recovery process into a game. What started as a simple motivational exercise became a set of rules she shared on her blog. These rules became a digital game, then an online portal and a major research study with the National Institutes of Health. Today more than 400,000 people have played SuperBetter to get happier and healthier.\n\nSuperBetter: A Revolutionary Approach - Happy B day Ruby","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c64b6dce28a007b50480071d99659c7dfc220c8c","amp;dn":"SuperBetter%3A+A+Revolutionary+Approach+-+Happy+B+day+Ruby","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c64b6dce28a007b50480071d99659c7dfc220c8c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,75,109,206,40,160,7,181,4,128,7,29,153,101,156,125,252,34,12,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
