The program provides free and easy access to openSUSE. Here you can find and join a community of users and developers, who all have the same goal in mind ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ to create and distribute the world&amp;#039;s most usable Linux. openSUSE also provides the base for Novell&amp;#039;s award-winning SUSE Linux Enterprise products.\n\n\n\nopenSUSE, is a general purpose Linux distribution developed by the openSUSE Project. After acquiring SUSE Linux in January 2004, Novell decided to release the SUSE Linux Professional product as a 100% open source project, involving the community in the development process. The initial release was a beta version of SUSE Linux 10.0, and as of June 2008 the current stable release is openSUSE 11.0.\n\nBeyond the distribution, the openSUSE Project provides a web portal for community involvement. The community assists in developing openSUSE collaboratively with representatives from Novell by contributing code through the openSUSE Build Service, writing documentation, designing artwork, fostering discussion on open mailing lists and in Internet Relay Chat channels, and improving the openSUSE site through its wiki interface. Novell employed over 500 developers working on SUSE in 2004. Novell markets openSUSE as the best, easiest distribution for all users.\n\nLike most distributions it includes both a default graphical user interface (GUI) and a command line interface option; it allows the user (during installation) to select which GUI they are comfortable with (either KDE 3.x, KDE 4.x GNOME or XFCE), and supports thousands of software packages across the full range of open source development.\n\nOpenSUSE 11.0 was released on June 19, 2008. It includes the latest version GNOME and two versions of KDE (the older, stable 3.5.9 and the newer 4.1). It comes in three freely downloadable versions: a complete installation DVD (including GNOME, KDE3, and KDE4), and two Live CDs (GNOME, and KDE4 respectively).\n\nA KDE3 Live CD was not produced, however, due to limited resources.\n\nPackage management and installation were made significantly faster with ZYpp.\n\n\nNew Look\n\nWith KDE 4.x being adopted in  openSUSE 11.0, YaST was ported over to Qt4 as well. This brought many enhancements, including the possibility of using Qt ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œcss-likeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ stylesheets for customising the look of YaST. Since YaST is used for the installer as well, this meant that it could easily acquire a great new look. Our resident artist Jakub ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“JimmacÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Steiner came up with a great design, and together with Stephan Kulow it was implemented.\n\nAs well as a visual change, the installer underwent many structural and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“under-the-hoodÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ changes to make the installation both easier and quicker. Many steps are now consolidated or removed where unnecessary, meaning that you can perform an entire openSUSE installation with just seven clicks! To see the full transition, check out KulowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s talk at FOSDEM (video, slides).\n\nWe ( openSUSE team) also switched to a pattern image-based installation, making the base installation an awful lot quicker. Package management has been significantly improved . The package management is now the fastest, smartest, and best performing of its kind, which also directly impacts on the installation time.\n\nFor openSUSE 11.0 we also made the switch from bzip2 to LZMA payload, resulting in both smaller RPMs (meaning the media can contain more packages and downloads are smaller), and faster decompression (meaning quicker installation of these packages). This switch alone means that RPM installation in some cases is up to 2.6 times faster!\n\nAll of these changes now mean that you can perform a complete openSUSE installation in under 20 minutes!\n\nOne of the primary media changes in openSUSE 11.0 is the removal of the previous 1-CD installation CDs. Now you have the chance of either the DVD installation (with KDE, GNOME, Xfce and much more), or a single GNOME live CD, or a KDE live CD ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ both of which are installable. \n\n\nLike the previous versions, it supports 32 bit PC, 64 bit PC, and PowerPC architectures.\n\n\nIMHO, it&amp;#039;s one of the most good-looking and user friendly Linux Distro&amp;#039;s available.\n\nI use OpenSuse Linux myself, I feel that it&amp;#039;s the best....\n\n&amp;#039;Nuff said.\n\n\n-UncleMonkey777","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c28e9fc14c2e0029bd18a38a167c8988719cecc","amp;dn":"%5BMonkeyVision%5D+OpenSuse+Linux+11.0+Live+CD+%2FInstaller+ISO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c28e9fc14c2e0029bd18a38a167c8988719cecc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,40,233,252,20,194,224,2,155,209,138,56,161,103,200,152,135,25,206,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
