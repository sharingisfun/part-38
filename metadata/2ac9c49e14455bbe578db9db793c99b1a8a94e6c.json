The story was adapted by BrÃƒÂ¡ulio Mantovani from the 1997 novel of the same name written by Paulo Lins, but the plot is loosely based on real events. It depicts the growth of organized crime in the Cidade de Deus suburb of Rio de Janeiro, between the end of the 1960s and the beginning of the 1980s, with the closure of the film depicting the war between the drug dealer Li'l ZÃƒÂ© and criminal Knockout Ned. The tagline is &quot;If you run, the beast catches; if you stay, the beast eats&quot;, (a proverb analogous to the English &quot;Damned if you do, damned if you don't&quot;).\n\nThe cast includes Alexandre Rodrigues, Leandro Firmino da Hora, Jonathan Haagensen, Douglas Silva, Alice Braga and Seu Jorge. Most of the actors were, in fact, residents of favelas such as Vidigal and the Cidade de Deus itself.\n\nThe film received four Academy Award nominations in 2004: Best Cinematography (CÃƒÂ©sar Charlone), Best Directing (Meirelles), Best Editing (Daniel Rezende) and Best Writing (Adapted Screenplay) (Mantovani).\n\n:[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_God_(2002_film)]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ac9c49e14455bbe578db9db793c99b1a8a94e6c","amp;dn":"City+of+God+%282002%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ac9c49e14455bbe578db9db793c99b1a8a94e6c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,201,196,158,20,69,91,190,87,141,185,219,121,60,153,177,168,169,78,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
