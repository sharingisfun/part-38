The band was named after a character from the Lewis Carroll poem &quot;Jabberwocky&quot;. Based out of San Francisco, California, the band was active from 1967 to 1969. Their initial three-song EP produced a minor underground hit with the song &quot;Hearts to Cry&quot;. A recording of their live work, titled A Young Man's Song, was released on the Big Beat label.\n\nThe band was formed across the bay from San Francisco in Contra Costa County, and changed personnel several times in their brief lifespan (1967Ã¢â‚¬â€œ69). Interest from several record companies came to naught, and the band's only release was a three-song EP on their own label, pressed in a quantity of 1000 and distributed locally.\n\nFour members of Frumious Bandersnatch (Bobby Winkelman, Jack King, Ross Valory, and David Denny) became regular members of the Steve Miller Band. Valory, along with fellow Frumious Bandersnatch member George Tickner and manager Herbie Herbert joined former Santana members Neal Schon and Gregg Rolie to form the band Journey in 1973.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBand:\n\nDavid Denny: Guitar\n\nJack King: Drums\n\nGeorge Tickner: Guitar\n\nRoss Valory: Bass\n\nBobby Winkelman: Rhythm Guitar, Bass\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ec940f22fdbc513dbef065d5078e94aa3a866ef","amp;dn":"Frumious+Bandersnatch+-+Flight+Of+The+Frumious...+%5B2008%5D%5B320KBPS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ec940f22fdbc513dbef065d5078e94aa3a866ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,201,64,242,47,219,197,19,219,239,6,93,80,120,233,74,163,168,102,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
