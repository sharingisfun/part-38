This     \n      time around it was a &quot;bdrip&quot;. Given the fact no src sample    \n      was supplied, the subs were not retail src (see some          \n      screenshots attached) and they never followed with an x264    \n      release we conclude it was a simple reencode from a german    \n      scene x264 rip combined with srt fansubs converted to         \n      vobsubs in a lame attempt to disguise they are not retail     \n      ones. Further more anyyone who knows how resized bluray .sup  \n      look like can easily tell the HLS subs didn't come from any   \n      bluray (resized bluray subs always look faint). In another    \n      pathetic attempt to make them look like retail subs they      \n      also converted them to some fancy font. Looking in the .idx   \n      file you'll find they were created with Subtitle Creator      \n      which is a tool for converting srt to vobsubs.                \n                                                                    \n      The same subs were also used before by another bunch of       \n      jokers called America but they weren't as sophisticated and   \n      pre'd them in their original srt glory.                       \n                                                                    \n      One can go and claim it's silly to proper over subs, we've    \n      heard shit like &quot;release just a subpack&quot;, well guess what?    \n      we don't want to.
