Condensation will not occur, provided that (a) the insulation surface is above the dewpoint temperature of the air; and (b) the insulation incorporates some form of water-vapour barrier or retarder that prevents water vapour from passing through the insulation to form on the pipe surface.\n\nFile Type: MS Word 2007 or above\nFile Size: 290 KB\n\nBrought you udistinguish by airgil\n\nPlease seed and share.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a4ec48cc38b45191409b26e6d8c60e0e680bbe2","amp;dn":"Specification+of+Pipe+Insulation","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a4ec48cc38b45191409b26e6d8c60e0e680bbe2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,78,196,140,195,139,69,25,20,9,178,110,109,140,96,224,230,128,187,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
