Burroughs and Anthony Burgess! Writer Tim Conrad boldly attempts to create a new world with its own language and culture.\n\nDark watercolor art dominates this book which follows the story of the first successful human clone. Dr. Victoria Gottway, a pioneering geneticist, clones herself. Unfortunately, Dr. GottwayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mountaintop lab explodes after a struggle with her disenchanted assistants.\n\nPhysically and intellectually optimized by some DNA manipulation, Dr. GottwayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s clone survives, though sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lost much of her memory. Vulnerable and lost in the world, she falls into the lives of many different people. Each wants her for reasons of his or her own, whether for financial gain, poetic inspiration, or simply love.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d82f7d52ef5e9116e3cb0c35522e67ba807c1c4","amp;dn":"ETC+%23+1-5+%28Piranha+Press%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d82f7d52ef5e9116e3cb0c35522e67ba807c1c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,130,247,213,46,245,233,17,110,60,176,195,85,34,230,123,168,7,193,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
