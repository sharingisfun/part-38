Never have. You are free to download whatever you want without having to grab the whole thing. It also helps me avoid creating another file with all the contents. Just click the number up in the corner by &quot;Files&quot; and voila, you have an amazing, almost magical list of all the files, courtesy of the brilliant folks at TPB. So if you want them zipped, download it and knock yourself out. Reupload it under your own name but don't forget the txt or nfo file with all the titles. \n\n---\n\nReseed and Enjoy!\n\n---","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56a303a2f414779a5940b4e927a5ee2339406d0b","amp;dn":"Mystery+Part+1+of+2+%28Mega+Pack+5%29+-+spanikopita","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56a303a2f414779a5940b4e927a5ee2339406d0b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,163,3,162,244,20,119,154,89,64,180,233,39,165,238,35,57,64,109,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
