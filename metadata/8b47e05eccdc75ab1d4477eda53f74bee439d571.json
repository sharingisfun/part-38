Ice-water makes the trichomes brittle, causing the resin glands to solidify and become easy to snap off. The glands are heavier than water so they sink to the bottom when separated, while the plant material floats.\nTo make hash this way you'll need a blender, ice cubes, a reusable metal coffee filter or silk screening, a large glass jar and paper coffee filters.\nFill the blender about half-way with skuff, then cover with cold water and add a tray of ice cubes. Blend for 45 seconds to a minute ? the mixture will become green and frothy, like a smoothie. Pour this mix through the metal coffee filter into your glass jar. Run more water through the filter to make sure you haven't missed any trichomes.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b47e05eccdc75ab1d4477eda53f74bee439d571","amp;dn":"og+10","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b47e05eccdc75ab1d4477eda53f74bee439d571","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,71,224,94,204,220,117,171,29,68,119,237,165,63,116,190,228,57,213,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
