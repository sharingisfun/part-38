Writer/director Adam Green (Hatchet) sets out to make a documentary exploring this tantalizing premise after being contacted by a mysterious man named William Dekker (Ray Wise). Dekker claims he can prove that Ã¢â‚¬Å“monsters are realÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and insists these grotesque creatures are forgotten, hideously deformed humanoids inhabiting a vast, underground metropolis of the damned. Determined to expose the truth, Green embarks on a bone-chilling odyssey and gets more than he bargains for when he dares to go Digging Up the Marrow.\n\nDirector: Adam Green\n\nWriters: Adam Green\n\nActors: Adam Green, Ray Wise, Will Barratt, Alex Pardee\n\nGenre: Thriller, Science Fiction, Action and Adventure\n\nRun Time: 1 hour 28 minutes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dbed26cc52c96e7a6ee44b5aaac2ac032f8587fb","amp;dn":"Digging+Up+the+Marrow.+Official+Movie+Trailer+%231+%5BHD%5D+%282015%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dbed26cc52c96e7a6ee44b5aaac2ac032f8587fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,237,38,204,82,201,110,122,110,228,75,90,170,194,172,3,47,133,135,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
