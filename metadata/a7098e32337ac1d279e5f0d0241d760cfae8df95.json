Its not a movie - its all real! Explore frightening true cases as investigated by acclaimed sci-fi author Arthur C. Clarke. Clarke and his team of highly respected scientific experts travel the globe seeking the truth behind the mythical creatures, ancient legends and hair raising rituals. Is it possible for the soul to leave the body for a glimpse of Heaven - or Hell? Are crop circles hard evidence of extraterrestrials, hoaxes.. or both? Is the face seen on new NASA photos of Mars a natural weather phenomenon or an indication that we are not alone?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a7098e32337ac1d279e5f0d0241d760cfae8df95","amp;dn":"Arthur+Clarke%27s+Misterious+Universe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a7098e32337ac1d279e5f0d0241d760cfae8df95","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,9,142,50,51,122,193,210,121,229,240,208,36,29,118,12,250,232,223,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
