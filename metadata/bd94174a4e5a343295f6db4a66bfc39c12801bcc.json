Every thing about movie is unique.It makes history by being the first rock concert after \nthe Berlin wall came down.If you are a fan of AC DC,METALLICA,PANTERA,BLACK CROWES and even a russian band \nE.S.T. who sound a lot like AC DC,you are really in for a treat.In my humble opinion,i think it should \nhave been an Oscar contender.Bad news is that its out of print. I was lucky enough somewhere along the \nway to have picked up video.Good luck on finding it.\n\nThey all put on a great show Enjoy {Blitz}\n      PLEASE SEED","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd94174a4e5a343295f6db4a66bfc39c12801bcc","amp;dn":"For+Those+About+to+Rock-Monsters+in+Moscow%5B1992%5D.XviD.avi-%7BBlitz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd94174a4e5a343295f6db4a66bfc39c12801bcc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,148,23,74,78,90,52,50,149,246,219,74,102,191,195,156,18,128,27,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
