He shows how it is a system that totalises and which has upended the modernity project by industrialised warfare, surveillance, commodification and control. With ever deepening crises and ecological catastrophes it threatens the total destruction of human civilisation. But in amongst this wreckage there are still functioning parts, machines to be salvaged through the collective force of the human imagination and the total mobilisation of the peoples of this earth. We must realise a different future to the apocalypticism forewarned by scientists, prescribed by economists, accommodated by politicians and made spectacle by the entertainment industry","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:610111c198d3a1d5716399571a89dda5ae8aa9ec","amp;dn":"Totalled%3A+Salvaging+the+Future+from+the+Wreckage","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"610111c198d3a1d5716399571a89dda5ae8aa9ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,1,17,193,152,211,161,213,113,99,153,87,26,137,221,165,174,138,169,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
