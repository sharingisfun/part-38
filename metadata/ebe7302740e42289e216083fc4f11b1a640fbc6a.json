Less obviously, so does the iPod touchÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½no phone,no cellular network (and the associated monthly fee), just a wonderful game-playing,application-downloading, insanely great Cocoa touch machine. Consumers love them both for their stability, ever-present network access, ineffable coolness, and (as we developers know firsthand) all of those great third-party apps.\nAppleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s App Store rocks, too, and as the owners of these devices have made it clear, games rock the most! The Wall Street Journal reported data from Mobclix showing that over a quarter\nof the applications in AppleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s App Store are games (see http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2009/03/23/no-recession-for-iphone-game-apps/). Venture capitalists are getting in on the action as well, financing game developer Ngmoco to the tune of $10 million. There has even been a conference devoted to gaming on the iPhone (see http://www.igsummit.com/).\nThink of this book as a guide and companion through your personal journey of game\ndevelopment for the iPhone and iPod touch. And like any good travel guide, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s full of tips, highlights, and invaluable suggestions for avoiding the costly and time-consuming mistakes of the early explorers who have gone before you.\nBut the life of the game developer is not all fun and, well, games, so thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s more. After all,games development requires knowledge of the same basic coding and language skills as any form of app development. So weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve loaded the book with code you can reuse as building blocks for your own apps. Even those developers who donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t have game development as their highest priority will find a lot of solid information here for use in their applications.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ebe7302740e42289e216083fc4f11b1a640fbc6a","amp;dn":"iPhone+Games+Projects","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ebe7302740e42289e216083fc4f11b1a640fbc6a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,231,48,39,64,228,34,137,226,22,8,63,196,241,27,26,100,15,188,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
