Under the guidance of svengali John Sinclair (the infamous founder of the radical White Panther Party), MC5 celebrated the holy trinity of sex, drugs, and rock &amp; roll, their incendiary live sets offering a defiantly bacchanalian counterpoint to the peace-and-love reveries of their hippie contemporaries. Although corporate censorship, label interference, and legal hassles combined to cripple the band's hopes of mainstream notoriety, both their sound and their sensibility remain seminal influences on successive generations of artists.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tFLAC Lossless\nLabel:\t\t\tRhino\nCatalog:\t\tR2 79783\nAudiochecker:\t\t99.86% CDDA\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n01.I Can Only Give You Everything\n02.Looking At You (Original &quot;A-Square&quot; Single Version)\n03.I Just Don't Know\n04.Ramblin' Rose\n05.Kick Out The Jams (Uncensored Version)\n06.Come Together\n07.Rocket Reducer No. 62 (Rama Lama Fa Fa Fa)\n08.Tonight\n09.Teenage Lust\n10.High School\n11.Call Me Animal\n12.The American Ruse\n13.Shakin' Street\n14.The Human Being Lawnmower\n15.Back In The USA\n16.Sister Anne\n17.Baby Won't Ya\n18.Miss X\n19.Over And Over\n20.Skunk (Sonicly Speaking)\n21.Thunder Express\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   ****Enjoy &amp; Please Don't Forget To Seed****\n                                      \n                                \n                                ****Thanks!****\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f9bbc54a29d6c958295c897f0076c8bdf7483a9","amp;dn":"MC5+-+The+Big+Bang%21+Best+Of+The+MC5+%282000%29+%5BFLAC%5D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f9bbc54a29d6c958295c897f0076c8bdf7483a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,155,188,84,162,157,108,149,130,149,200,151,240,7,108,139,223,116,131,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
