ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not their music or\never-changing image that's the problem. It's Corey's lack of lyrics. He just can't\nthink of anything cool to write about, until... he finds his older sister Trina's\ndiary. &quot;Hey! This thing is full of teen angst and junk.&quot; Core and the band\n'secretly' use her latest diary entry for lyrics to their new tune - and what do\nyou know? It sounds like pure awesomeness and the gigs are lining up! Problem solved\nright? Not exactly. Trina's a total witch and can't stand the thought of her little\nbrother's garbage band becoming more popular than her. She'll stop at nothing to\ncrush their dreams. But that's cool. Core can read his sister, well... like a book.\nAnd he always knows just what to do to make her go diary and give them the one thing\nthey're missing... words! Follow Corey and his GROJBAND as they reach for the top.\nGasp at the things they'll do to his sister's fragile teenage world to get there.\n\nProduced by Fresh TV and Teletoon Canada.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img692/8523/lubl.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img692/8523/lubl.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\nCorey takes the coolness of Indie music a little too far and enters the band\nin the local Indie Indie 400 - a race with no rules. When Trina turns the\nother drivers against them, the band is more concerned about staying alive.\n\nGrogband's next gig is at the Trymathelon. Trina tells the Mayor that Kon has failed\nmath for six straight years, and if Kon wins the Trymathelon, they get to play!\n\nGrojband.S01E03.In-D.Road.Rager.-.Math.of.Kon.720p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.AAC2.0.H.264-YFN\n\nFormat: Matroska Video File (MKV)\nVideo: MPEG4 Video (H264) 1280x720 23.976fps\nAudio 1: Dolby AC3 48000Hz 6 channels 384Kbps\nAudio 2: MPEG4 Audio (AAC) 48000Hz stereo\nSubs: English Closed Captions (SubRip Text)\nDuration: 00:21:54\nFile size: 725 MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32ae2c3e628bc44bac3002679ca18ad594ed2446","amp;dn":"Grojband.S01E03.720p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.AAC2.0.H.264-YFN","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32ae2c3e628bc44bac3002679ca18ad594ed2446","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,174,44,62,98,139,196,75,172,48,2,103,156,161,138,213,148,237,36,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
