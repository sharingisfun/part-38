When it does, it&amp;#039;s very funny - my favourite exchange being (paraphrased) &quot;It&amp;#039;s up to the Americans to save the day again!&quot;, &quot;God, I wish I was an American!&quot;. The rest of the time, though, it seems content to simply be a wacky slapstick comedy that gets its laughs from making prominent historical figures look a little ridiculous. Sometimes this works - I adored Neve Campbell&amp;#039;s performance as Elizabeth, as well as her hilariously overdone accent... in fact she&amp;#039;s probably the best part of the movie - but other times it doesn&amp;#039;t, for example with Goering and Goebbels. It also has a habit of making its jokes too obvious at times, as if writer/director Peter Richardson was afraid that audiences wouldn&amp;#039;t get it: it&amp;#039;s not enough for Churchill&amp;#039;s fellow GI, an African-American, to be relegated to the role of the stereotypical black comic relief character, he actually has to point this out to us.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe930fd5bfec69a978059ae4f4d0d66d26997f46","amp;dn":"Churchill.The.Hollywood.Years.2005.DVDRiP.XviD.LIMITED-LRC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe930fd5bfec69a978059ae4f4d0d66d26997f46","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,147,15,213,191,236,105,169,120,5,154,228,244,208,214,109,38,153,127,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
