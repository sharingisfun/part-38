The Nazi officer leading the raid offers Anatoly the choice to shoot Tikhon and stay alive which Anatoly reluctantly takes, and Tikhon falls overboard. The Nazis blow up the ship but Anatoly is found by monks on the shore the next morning. He survives and becomes a stoker at the monastery, but is perpetually overcome with guilt.\n\nThirty years pass... Anatoly now has the gift of clairvoyance and healing. But the other monks don't really understand him. People come to see Anatoly for cures and guidance. But even now, he remains in a perpetual state of repentance. He often gets in a boat and goes to an uninhabited island where he prays for mercy and forgiveness.\n\nA prominent admiral arrives to see Anatoly with his daughter. The daughter is possessed by demons but Anatoly exorcises them. The admiral turns out to be Tikhon. It is revealed that Anatoly only wounded him during the war. Tikhon forgives Anatoly.\n\nAnatoly can now die peacefully. The monks discover that he has foreknowledge of his death and make him a coffin out of a coal box. he lies down in it, and dies. The coffin is buried on the uninhabited island where he spent his time praying.\n\nCast\n\n    * Pyotr Mamonov ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢?? father Anatoly\n    * Viktor Sukhorukov ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢?? father Filaret\n    * Dmitry Dyuzhev ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢?? father Iov (Job)\n    * Yuriy Kuznetsov ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢??
