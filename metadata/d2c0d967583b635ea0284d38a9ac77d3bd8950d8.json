Admiral  Ackbar.  That   dude   who\ncommands  the  G.I.   Joes.   These   totally   rad\ncommanders knew that  battles  are  won  not  by  a\nsingle footsoldier, but by issuing precise commands\nthat  put  their  units  in  position  to   achieve\nvictory. In There Came an  Echo,  follow  in  those\ncommanders' footsteps by giving  orders  to  Corrin\nWebb (Wil Wheaton) and his squadmates in  a  unique\nreal-time strategy experience.  Using  an  advanced\nvoice recognition system, direct your units through\na variety of mission types against foes armed  with\nfuturistic  energy  weaponry  and  personal   force\nfields. Make your move with standard commands (&quot;All\nunits, advance to  Bravo  3!&quot;)  or  utilize  custom\nvariants  to  express   your   unique   personality\n(&quot;Everyone, do the worm over to Buttface 3!&quot;). Keep\nit classy,  folks.  Follow  a  complex,  character-\ndriven   sci-fi   plot:   Corrin,    an    ordinary\ncryptographer, is thrown  into  a  deadly  game  of\nsecret agendas when a group of  mercenaries  tracks\nhim down in Santa Monica, California. Guided by the\nmysterious Val (Ashly Burch),  Corrin  must  escape\nfrom a foe with seemingly limitless  resources  and\ndiscover   what   secrets   his   own   unbreakable\nalgorithm,   Radial   Lock,   is    safeguarding...\ninformation that, if released, will rattle the very\nfoundations of reality itself. Also starring  Laura\nBailey, Yuri Lowenthal,  Cassandra  Morris,  Rachel\nRobinson, and Cindy Robinson.\n\n***Note:  There  Came  an  Echo,  though   designed\nprimarily for voice  commands,  is  fully  playable\nwithout them.***\n\n1- Unpack, burn or mount\n2- Install the game (agree on installing all redists\nat the end of installation process)\n3- Copy the cracked content from PROPHET dir\n4- Go To Hell!\n\nPROPER:\nCODEX propered DOGE with 100% identical  files  and\nwith a crack working 100% the same. So why was DOGE\nrls  not  working  properly?  Surprise,  it   works\nproperly when you have the Microsoft Server  Speech\nPlatform  Runtime  Redists  installed   (they   are\nincluded in DOGE release, but not  run  by  default\nafter installation). Legit users also  have  issues\nwhen Steam failed to install those  redists,  check\nSteam forum. So  after  *Locked  DLCs*,  *Publisher\nmistake*  we  also  add  *Redists  not  run   after\ninstallation* to  our  valid  proper  reason  list.\nCODEX may be surprised but some  users  have  these\nredists installed and DOGE release works  fine  for\nthem. It's the same like propering for not  running\nDirectX or VC++ redists by default (not  all  users\nhave them installed). So after analysing new proper\nstandards we decided  that  PROPER  from  CODEX  is\nunacceptable. DOGE  release  is  2.41GB,  CODEX  is\n7.22GB with same files included, so  it's  3  times\nbigger and doesn't fit to  DVD5  anymore.  We  find\nunacceptable to proper DVD5  release  with  a  DVD9\ncontaining same files. Also  DVD9  must  be  packed\ninto 100mb rars, CODEX rls is packed incorrectly in\n50mb parts","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d2c0d967583b635ea0284d38a9ac77d3bd8950d8","amp;dn":"There.Came.an.Echo.REAL.PROPER-PROPHET","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d2c0d967583b635ea0284d38a9ac77d3bd8950d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,192,217,103,88,59,99,94,160,40,77,56,169,172,119,211,189,137,80,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
