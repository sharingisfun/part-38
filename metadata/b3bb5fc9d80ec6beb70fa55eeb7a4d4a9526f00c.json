It was the band's seventh studio album and eighth release overall.\n\nThe original vinyl record included 12 tracks. &quot;You Talk Too Much&quot; and &quot;Don't Make Our Love a Crime&quot; appeared as bonus tracks on the cassette version and later on the CD. The record was originally supposed to include both of these tracks along with two others called &quot;Twisted Heart&quot; and &quot;Don't Hit Me With Love,&quot; but Cheap Trick's label at the time, Epic Records, forced the band to include a cover of The Motors' &quot;Dancing the Night Away&quot; and the outtake &quot;You Say Jump&quot; in their place. Rundgren refused to produce &quot;Dancing the Night Away,&quot; so the track ended up being produced by the band with Ian Taylor, who had engineered the band's previous album, One on One. &quot;Twisted Heart&quot; eventually surfaced on the box set Sex, America, Cheap Trick. There was one video shot for this LP; &quot;I Can't Take It.&quot;\n\nIn 2006, Cheap Trick and Epic/Legacy reissued Next Position Please as a digital download, calling it Next Position Please (The Authorized Version). The title refers to the fact that the 13 tracks intended for the original album were restored and sequenced according to the band's wishes, while &quot;You Say Jump&quot; and &quot;Dancing the Night Away&quot; were put at the end as &quot;bonus tracks&quot; along with the previously unreleased track &quot;Don't Hit Me With Love.&quot; The track &quot;I Don't Love Here Anymore&quot; is incorrectly titled &quot;I Don't Love Her Anymore.&quot;\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n2006 &quot;Authorized&quot; reissue\n\n    &quot;I Can't Take It&quot;\n    &quot;Borderline&quot;\n    &quot;I Don't Love Here Anymore&quot;\n    &quot;Next Position Please&quot;\n    &quot;Younger Girls&quot;\n    &quot;Don't Make Our Love a Crime&quot;\n    &quot;3-D&quot;\n    &quot;You Talk Too Much&quot;\n    &quot;Y.O.Y.O.Y.&quot;\n    &quot;Won't Take No for an Answer&quot;\n    &quot;Heaven's Falling&quot;\n    &quot;Invaders of the Heart&quot;\n    &quot;Twisted Heart&quot;\n    &quot;Don't Hit Me With Love&quot;\n    &quot;You Say Jump&quot;\n    &quot;Dancing the Night Away&quot;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b3bb5fc9d80ec6beb70fa55eeb7a4d4a9526f00c","amp;dn":"Cheap+Trick+-+Next+Position+Please+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b3bb5fc9d80ec6beb70fa55eeb7a4d4a9526f00c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,187,95,201,216,14,198,190,183,15,165,94,235,122,77,74,149,38,240,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
