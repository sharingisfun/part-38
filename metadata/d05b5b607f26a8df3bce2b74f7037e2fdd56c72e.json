There was no rock 'n' roll before Bill Hayley and the Comets. There was pop, there was country, there was rhythm and blues. But rock 'n' roll -combining them all- was virtually invented by Bill Hayley and the Comets and no one's been the same since.\n\nThis is my first real attempt to clean up a vinyl recording and I've uploaded it as MP3 purely for size reasons, I don't think the quality is to bad considering when it was recorded.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d05b5b607f26a8df3bce2b74f7037e2fdd56c72e","amp;dn":"Bill+Haley+and+the+Comets-Live+in+London+%281974%29+vinyl+320kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d05b5b607f26a8df3bce2b74f7037e2fdd56c72e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,91,91,96,127,38,168,223,59,206,43,116,247,3,126,47,221,86,199,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
