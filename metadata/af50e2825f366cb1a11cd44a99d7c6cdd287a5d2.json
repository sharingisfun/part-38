God Smiles (by Tilman Sillescu)\n14. Inside The Womb (by Alexander RÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶der)\n22. Perfect Order (by Markus Schmidt)\n25. Release\n29. Rest Your Head (by Alexander RÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶der)\n31. Surely Dr. Devi Knows (by Tilman Sillescu)\nTycoon:\n02. Anybody Need Anything? (by Markus Schmidt)\n10. Dominion (by Markus Schmidt)\n32. The Final Hour\n37. God Smiles (English vocals) (by Tilman Sillescu)\n\nTracks from the list above that are present in this torrent AND are tagged appropriately:\n09. God Smiles (by Tilman Sillescu)\n02. Anybody Need Anything? (by Markus Schmidt)\n37. God Smiles (English vocals) (by Tilman Sillescu)\n\nThe following tracks are included, but have no tags (it is likely that some of them are the ones from the list above, but it is impossible to tell for sure without listening to the original CDs):\nUnknown Eco music 1 (instrumental version of Walking Barefoot and We Will Carry You)\nUnknown Eco music 2\nUnknown Eco music 3 (underwater?)\nUnknown Tycoon music 1 (The Old World Order theme variation)\nUnknown Eco music 4 (Project Earth variation)\nUnknown Eco music 5\nUnknown Eco music 6 (underwater?)\nUnknown Tycoon music 2\n\nThings to note:\n* Anno 2070 stored all music tracks encoded in mp3. This torrent provides them in that format exactly, without re-encoding.\n* Collateral Damage, Drone Predators and Civilian Casualties are split into parts. They were stored like that in the game.\n* Drone Predators (second part) cuts off abruptly at the end. It was like that in the game.\n* The sound skips at the start of Grinding Teeth. It was like that in the game, and it is like that in the CDrip version. This is not a glitch.\n* All track numbers are set according to the complete (and the longest) track list on CD covers, which means that there are gaps in numbering, since some tracks are missing or unidentified.\n* In all available rips of the 2-disk set the tracks Our Borrowed Time and Tumbling Raindrops are identical. This torrent includes one track named &quot;Our Borrowed Time (Tumbling Raindrops)&quot;\nIt is not unlikely that the 8 unknown tracks consist of 7 tracks from the missing list and the track that was originally supposed to be named Our Borrowed Time or Tumbling Raindrops, but was replaced by a duplicate instead.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af50e2825f366cb1a11cd44a99d7c6cdd287a5d2","amp;dn":"Anno+2070+OST+%282011%29+%28mp3%2C+gamerip%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af50e2825f366cb1a11cd44a99d7c6cdd287a5d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,80,226,130,95,54,108,177,161,28,212,74,153,215,198,205,210,135,165,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
