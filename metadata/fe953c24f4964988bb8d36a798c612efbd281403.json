Rancid and Social D. have a historyÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ Mike played guitar onstage with Rancid at Roseland in New York in 1996, and Matt Freeman played bass with Social D. on tour. We used to love seeing Johnny Two Bags play in Cadillac Tramps, and during his stint in U.S. Bombs. You can see how intertwined we are.\n \nTim Timebomb Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Guitar, Vocals\nDash Hutton Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Drums, Background Vocals\nTim Hutton Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Bass, Background Vocals\nKevin Bivona Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Additional Guitars, Organ\nBrandon Intelligator Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Pedal Steel","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe953c24f4964988bb8d36a798c612efbd281403","amp;dn":"Bad+Luck+-+Tim+Timebomb+and+Friends.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe953c24f4964988bb8d36a798c612efbd281403","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,149,60,36,244,150,73,136,187,141,54,167,152,198,18,239,189,40,20,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
