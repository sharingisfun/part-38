As the characters use attacks, they level up and learn new attacks. Powerful attacks require SP, represented by a yellow meter, to use. The player encounters many small enemies while progressing, and every once in a while finds a stone altar with a crystal that creates an opponent from the series as a boss. In between the fights, the player mostly collects items to be used back at camp. Camp is where the player can save, sort and store items and have the other characters use their special talents.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:468045f8928ade2ac0781bd675da4d09cc4192bb","amp;dn":"One.Piece.Unlimited.Adventure.USA.Wii.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"468045f8928ade2ac0781bd675da4d09cc4192bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,128,69,248,146,138,222,42,192,120,27,214,117,218,77,9,204,65,146,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
