A collection of mostly mellow tracks recorded between 1961 and 1964, this record is a perfect choice for those who have never been able to &quot;get&quot; Coltrane's later, more experimental work, or newbies who are not quite ready for the cerebral qualities of straight hard bop.\n\nIn addition to a selection of excellent recordings featuring the classic Coltrane lineup of Mcoy Tyner, Jimmy Garrison and Elvin Jones, there are also two tracks from Coltrane's historic 1962 album with Duke Ellington. These performances remind the listener that Ellington, while best remembered as a composer, was a gifted pianist who always cut right to the emotional heart of the music. Also included are songs from Coltrane's collaboration with vocalist Johnny Hartman and several lovely tunes in the &quot;tone poem&quot; vein, including the gorgeous and sad &quot;After the Rain.&quot; Wrapping things up is &quot;I Want to Talk About You,&quot; a good live example of the famous Coltrane &quot;sheets of sound&quot;--just in case anyone was getting too relaxed.\n\n\n\nRecorded at Van Gelder Studios, Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey.\n\nThe John Coltrane Quartet: John Coltrane (tenor saxophone); McCoy Tyner (piano); Jimmy Garrison (bass); Elvin Jones (drums).\n\nAdditional personnel: Johnny Hartman (vocals); Duke Ellington (piano); Aaron Bell (bass); Sam Woodyard, Roy Haynes (drums).Q (3/92, p.85) - 4 Stars - Excellent - &quot;...the Coltrane sound conveyed a lyrical gentleness and pure sense of quest...an excellent compilation of epiphanic moments...&quot;\nDown Beat (3/92, p.47) - 4 Stars - Very Good -","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:685b6a12114dcd6ca7d6f97227beffe6d4aa7123","amp;dn":"John+Coltrane+-+The+Gentle+Side+Of+John+Coltrane+%281991%29+%5BFLAC%5D+-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"685b6a12114dcd6ca7d6f97227beffe6d4aa7123","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,91,106,18,17,77,205,108,167,214,249,114,39,190,255,230,212,170,113,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
