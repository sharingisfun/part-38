With the exception of a few skits ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ featuring the likes of Bobby Darin as a used car salesman and Diana Ross, who is credited simply as &quot;the Pregnant Lady&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the album includes some of the less visually dependent material. The first half of the program was a buildup to the &quot;homecoming&quot; concert. That Gary, IN, performance was held on May 29, 1971, and highlights were excerpted in the final portion of the television show. The long-player replicates that concept, with side one boasting guest shots from Bill Cosby as roving reporter Skip Newsworthy and Tommy Smothers as &quot;the Crimson Ghost,&quot; an adversary for Tito Jackson's race-car fantasy sequence. Perhaps most impressive is the all-star basketball &quot;dream team&quot; with Elgin Baylor, Ben Davison, Elvin Hayes, and Bill Russell. The latter can be heard during the recitation of &quot;The Day Basketball Was Saved&quot; as the NBA legends go head to head with the Jacksons. Although not documented in front of an audience, the &quot;rehearsal&quot; versions of &quot;I Want You Back&quot; and &quot;Maybe Tomorrow&quot; sport fresh lead vocals over the top of the familiar instrumental backing. Every one of the live cuts crackles with practically palpable energy, especially the covers of Sly &amp; the Family Stone's &quot;Stand!,&quot; the reworking of Dave Mason's &quot;Feelin' Alright,&quot; and the piledriving title track, &quot;Goin' Back to Indiana.&quot;\n\nTracks:\n\nI Want You Back\nMaybe Tomorrow \t\nThe Day Basketball Was Saved \nStand!  4:15\nI Want to Take You Higher \nFeelin' Alright  \nMedley: Walk On/\n The Love You Save/\n Goin' Back to Indiana\n\nRipped from the original vinyl.\nGrade: VG- \n\nCD out of print.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d81c847105325e2289336fbaa206ca1cbd2a0b3","amp;dn":"1971.The.Jackson.5.Goin%5C%27.Back.to.Indiana.TV.Stk.V","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d81c847105325e2289336fbaa206ca1cbd2a0b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,129,200,71,16,83,37,226,40,147,54,251,170,32,108,161,203,210,160,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
