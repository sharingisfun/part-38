This\nrelease was commissioned by Arts for Art, the producers of the Vision Festival\nfor the 2007 event, together with Roy CampbellÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Akhenaten Suite and William\nParkerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s orchestral work Double Sunrise Over Neptune (due in August).\n\nThe band consists of Bill Dixon on trumpet, Graham Haynes, Stephen Haynes and\nTaylor Ho Bynum on cornet and flugelhorn; Dick Griffin and Steve Swell on tenor\ntrombone; Joseph Daly on tuba; Karen Borca on bassoon; Will Connell on bass\nclarinet; Michel Cote on Bb contrabass clarinet; Andrew Raffo Dewar on soprano\nsax, John Hagen on tenor sax, baritone sax; J.D.Parran on bass saxophone and\nbamboo flute; Glynis Loman on cello; Andrew Lafkas on bass; Jackson Krall on\ndrums and percussion, and finally Warren Smith on vibes, tympani, drums.\n\n&quot;17 Musicians In Search Of A Sound : Darfur&quot; is a long musical suite, centered\naround the long &quot;Sinopia&quot;. Sinopia is the color of dry earth, the color\nunderpinning oil paintings. The color is red. The color of blood. Short tracks\nfull of foreboding, dark and menacing horns, playing slow, magnificent,\ncinematic music, verging on classical, in which low unison tones build a\nhorrifying dramatic atmosphere, with percussion added to for full effect, rather\nthan for supporting the rhythm. In some of the initial moments, the cello and\narco bass strain away from the unison theme to create some dissonant sounds, on\nsome of the other tracks, the dark wave of sound stops to let the individual\nvoices of the various instruments wail and weep, in duet, or with the full band,\ncreating full and intense chaos, stopping abruptly and rejoining the ranks of\nthe main sound. On &quot;Scattering Of The Following&quot;, the individual instruments get\ntheir first chance for real improvisation, with trumpet, tuba, bass saxophone\nand vibes setting the scene, one full of disarray and emotional distress. The\ntune &quot;Darfur&quot; offers the darkest pieces of orchestrated gloom and doom you may\nhave heard so far, stopping halfway for squealing sax sounds and screeching arco\nbass, supported by irregular drumming, moving the music to a crescendo of\ndespair, which is followed by solo trumpet, intervening arco bass, and slowly\nthe whole ensemble joins, slowly, irrevocably.\n\n&quot;Sinopia&quot; starts with baritone solo, and slowly evolves into the most\navant-garde moment of the record, with one instrumental solo taking over from\nthe other, and though the various musicians freely improvise, there is clear\nstructure about when what happens and about who does what, even if the content\nitself is free, but gradually they start weaving a coherent sound, all\ncontributing to the overall darkness, despite the diversity of sounds created by\nthe individual instruments. It is both primal and funereal, ending in sheer\nagony.\n\nThis center pieces is followed by four short tracks, mirroring the opening\ntracks of the record, again with slow dark, gloomy and menacing ensemble sounds,\ncalled &quot;Pentimenti&quot;, meaning traces of changes made by the painter, showing that\nhe has changed his mind and started differently. The references to painting,\nboth in the titles and on the cover, also demonstrate the composer's interest in\ncreating colors of sound, creating new mixtures, new approaches, and he succeeds\nin this.\n\nThe end result is surely one of the musical highlights of the year. It is\nuncompromising, but clever, with a band of great musicians who play in an\nincredibly controlled and focused manner. And it succeeds in every aspect where\nEvan Parker's &quot;Boustrophedon&quot; falls short. It uses the orchestra to its full\npotential, creating true music, powerful, deeply emotional, coherent in the\nimpactful listening experience it creates. Bill Dixon manages to create a wide\narray of musical emotions through playing with music's endless possibilities,\nwhile at the same time touching upon the tragedy of Darfur. This is a strong and\npowerful musical statement. And it is infinitely sad.\n\nMore:\n-----\nBy Michael G.
