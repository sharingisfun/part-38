The term &quot;Crisis&quot; was a word used frequently in DC Comics of the time, as it denoted an inter-dimensional crossover, such as the yearly Justice League/Justice Society crossovers that began with &quot;Crisis on Earth-Two&quot;.\nWolfman came up with an idea which would reach across the entirety of the DC Universe and its 50-year history. First of all, he came up with the character of the Monitor who was initially a faceless character used in many of DC&amp;#039;s titles over the course of a year. The Monitor supplied DC&amp;#039;s villains with equipment in order to test its heroes for the Crisis ahead. As a result, the character was seen to be a villain himself and his real reasons were not revealed to the reader until Crisis #1.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e844ff5164b351131a36ba64cf9cf712b5a3dbd","amp;dn":"Crisis+On+Infinite+Earths","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e844ff5164b351131a36ba64cf9cf712b5a3dbd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,132,79,245,22,75,53,17,49,163,107,166,76,249,207,113,43,90,61,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
