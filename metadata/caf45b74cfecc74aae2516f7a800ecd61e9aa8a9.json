It's been described as a Romantic Comedy and a Harem Comedy before, due to it's dating minigames and it's rather large cast of female characters. The game went tragically unnoticed in the United States due to poor distribution and little advertisement in the wake of mainstream titles, but Atlus did a wonderful job on this and it still has a cult following. \n\nThis game works well on the ePSXe emulator, which you can download with bios and plug-ins from another torrent. If you like it, please seed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:caf45b74cfecc74aae2516f7a800ecd61e9aa8a9","amp;dn":"%28PSX%29+Thousand+Arms+%28USA-NTSC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"caf45b74cfecc74aae2516f7a800ecd61e9aa8a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,244,91,116,207,236,199,74,174,37,22,247,168,0,236,214,30,154,168,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
