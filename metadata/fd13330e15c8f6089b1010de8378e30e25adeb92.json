Searchable pdf (clearscan) with contents in bookmarks, accurate pagination and metadata, etc.\n\nBless Me, Ultima is a novel by Rudolfo Anaya in which his young protagonist, Antonio MÃƒÂ¡rez y Luna tells the story of his coming-of-age with the guidance of his curandera, mentor, and protector, Ultima. It has become the most widely read and critically acclaimed novel in the Chicano literary canon since its first publication in 1972.\n\nBecause Bless Me, Ultima contains adult language, and because some of the content is violent and contains sexual references, it has been included in the list of most commonly challenged books in the U.S. in 2008.\n\n---\n\nQuite extraordinary ... intersperses the legendary, folkloric, stylized, or allegorized material with ... realistic.\n\n--Latin American Literary Review\n\nAn unforgettable novel ... already becoming a classic for its uniqueness on story, narrative technique, and structure.\n\n--Chicano Perspectives in Literature\n\n---\n\nback cover:\n\nStories filled with wonder and the haunting beauty of his culture have helped make Rudolfo Anaya the father of Chicano literature in English, and his tales fairly shimmer with the lyric richness of his prose. Acclaimed in both Spanish and English, Anaya is perhaps best loved for his classic bestseller Bless Me, Ultima.\n\nAntonio Marez is six years old when Ultima comes to stay with his family in New Mexico. She is a curandera, one who cures with herbs and magic. Under her wise wing, Tony will test the bonds that tie him to his people, and discover himself in the pagan past, in his father's wisdom, and in his mother's Catholicism. And at each life turn there is Ultima, who delivered Tony into the world - and will nurture the birth of his soul. \n\n\n\nAbout the Author\n\nRudolfo Anaya is professor emeritus of English at the University of New Mexico.
