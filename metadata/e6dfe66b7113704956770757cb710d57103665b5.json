Well, I decided I wasn't patient enough to wait for him, so I took matters into my own hands to edit and compile what I think could've been a realistic take on this album. \n\nSince many pivotal recordings remain unreleased, I took some liberties in a few places, using some of Rivers' demos that weren't necessarily associated with SFTBH, as well as some later Weezer material, Pinkerton tracks, B-sides, and a few covers I managed to find on the internet.  I tried my best to flesh out the album wherever I could, and I also tried my best to combined both track listings from the original SFTBH demos to recreate the plot that Rivers had intended. I think it works surprisingly well.\n\nTo top it all off, I've also edited the songs so that they flow seamlessly into each other, since that's another thing Rivers originally had in mind. I think it's one of the coolest aspects of this album, and it definitely helps you hear just how amazing this project was going to be. Trust me, it was (and hopefully still is) going to be amazing. And as long as Rivers Cuomo is still alive and kicking, so will the greatest space rock opera the world has never heard.\n\n\nBy the way, everything here is copyrighted to Weezer. If you have enjoyed this album, I highly encourage you to pick up some Weezer records if you don't already own them. The same goes for Rivers Cuomo's solo demo compilation &quot;Alone: The Home Recordings of Rivers Cuomo&quot;, which has helped shed a lot of light on the mystery and mystique of SFTBH. \n\nEnjoy this album, and KEEP THE ROCK!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6dfe66b7113704956770757cb710d57103665b5","amp;dn":"Weezer+-+Songs+from+the+Black+Hole+%5BFINAL%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6dfe66b7113704956770757cb710d57103665b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,223,230,107,113,19,112,73,86,119,7,87,203,113,13,87,16,54,101,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
