Noted for their idiosyncratic approach to music, Cake (often stylized as CAKE) became popular in the late 1990s with their album Fashion Nugget, which spawned several singles, with &quot;The Distance&quot; being the highest-charting single. Cake's musical style is characterized by lead singer John McCrea's half-sung, half-spoken vocals and lyrical wordplay. The band has switched out several members in the years since its first album, Motorcade of Generosity, in 1994. Their sixth full-length album, Showroom of Compassion, is scheduled to be released on January 11, 2011.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cake_%28band%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cake_%28band%29&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\nShowroom of Compassion is the name of the new Cake album, scheduled to be released on January 11, 2011. This will be their first album since the release of Pressure Chief in 2004, the longest gap to date between two consecutive Cake studio albums. John McCrea stated that this album will sound &quot;very different.&quot; He said he allowed acoustic piano on the LP, which he had never done because he thought it sounded &quot;too classy.&quot; He also said this is the first time he has allowed reverb, which he thought too many bands used to sound &quot;grandiose.&quot;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showroom_of_Compassion&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showroom_of_Compassion&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n01 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Federal Funding\n02 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Long Time\n03 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Got To Move\n04 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ WhatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Now is Now\n05 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Mustache Man (Wasted)\n06 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Teenage Pregnancy\n07 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Sick of You\n08 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Easy To Crash\n09 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Bound Away\n10 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ The Winter\n11 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Italian Guy\n\n\n\n\n\nMore info:\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.cakemusic.com/news.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.cakemusic.com/news.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://cake.hasawebstore.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://cake.hasawebstore.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cake_%28band%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cake_%28band%29&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showroom_of_Compassion&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showroom_of_Compassion&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nENJOY &amp; REMEMBER TO KEEP SEEDING FOR OTHERS!!!\nTHANKS!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fab8059cd9e6dea44b4704cb4f27671aee7c31cd","amp;dn":"Cake+-+Showroom+of+Compassion+%282011%29%28ADVANCE%29%28Indie+Alternative+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fab8059cd9e6dea44b4704cb4f27671aee7c31cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,184,5,156,217,230,222,164,75,71,4,203,79,39,103,26,238,124,49,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
