A few border on fantasy, such as the poignant &quot;Born With the Dead&quot; (1974) with its theme of loss. Others reflect the experimental trends that emerged in the 1960s and proved unpopular with fans, such as &quot;Schwartz Between the Galaxies&quot; (1973), which remains less readable than the author's usual. &quot;Sailing to Byzantium&quot; (1985) may be Silverberg's ultimate triumph, a dazzling mix of archeology and haunting fantasy. In the brief introductory essays to each section, divided by decade, as well as the illuminating essays for each story, Silverberg comes across as neither unduly modest nor arrogant.\n\n\nRead by Steven Carpenter\nFormat: MP3\nBitrate: 64 Kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aab0c62cf2b9ea52dc9be5594c3748849724da69","amp;dn":"Robert+Silverberg+-+Phases+Of+The+Moon","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aab0c62cf2b9ea52dc9be5594c3748849724da69","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,176,198,44,242,185,234,82,220,155,229,89,76,55,72,132,151,36,218,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
