Deadliest Catch features the wild and treacherous life of the crab fisherman. This dramatic series will document the end of an era-what veteran crab fishermen are calling &quot;The Last Rodeo.&quot; The first season documents the last time race, as it is the last season where they are pitted against the clock. Later seasons contains a less action packed theme, and delves deeper into the lives and minds of those on the boats. We follow the crews through laughter and sorrow while on the hunt for crab. The series is dedicated to the brave men and women lost at sea, and to the families they left behind.\n\n\nDeadliest Catch Season 4 Episode 15\n\nCatch as Catch Can (Jul/15/2008)\n\nAs the fleets make their final push they descend upon an Arctic ice pack.
