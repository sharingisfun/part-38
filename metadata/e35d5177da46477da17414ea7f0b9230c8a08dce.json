Paul Morphy dazzled the chess world with breathtaking combinations that seemed to arise from thin air. In his brief chess career, he was universally recognized as the best in the world. International grandmaster Valeri Beim takes a close look at the play of the mid-19th century champion, putting his games under a modern, 21st-century analytical microscope. The result is a fresh and instructive look at the strategy and tactics of the American legend, and their relevance to the modern approach to the royal game.\n\nIt is a very interesting book and may well change the readerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s preconceived ideas in the same way. Game annotations are the main component but there is also background information on Morphy. -- John Saunders, British Chess Magazine, October 2005","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e35d5177da46477da17414ea7f0b9230c8a08dce","amp;dn":"Paul+Morphy+%26ndash%3B+A+Modern+Perspective+%28Valerie+Beim%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e35d5177da46477da17414ea7f0b9230c8a08dce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,93,81,119,218,70,71,125,161,116,20,234,127,11,146,48,200,160,141,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
