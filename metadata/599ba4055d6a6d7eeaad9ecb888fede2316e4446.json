This is especially true since the advent of the compact disc. These sessions not only capture Parker's alto brillance but highlight his interaction with such jazz stalwarts as Dizzy Gillespie, Miles Davis, Duke Jordan, Max Roach, Erroll Garner, Howard McGhee and Dodo Marmarosa. This four-disc set is broken up into Hollywood Sessions 1: Moose the Mooche, Hollywood Sessions 2: Relaxin' at Camarillo, New York Sessions 1: Scrapple from the Apple, and New York Sessions 2: Drifting on a Reed. It's fortunate that these slices of jazz history are available allowing the listener to hear several takes of classics like &quot;Moose the Mooch,&quot; &quot;Relaxin at Camarillo,&quot; &quot;Scrapple from the Apple,&quot; and &quot;Ornithology&quot; take shape. Sound quality on these Jazz Classics discs is good for the most part, fair but not great on others. ~ Al Campbell Illustrator: Alan Nahigian.
