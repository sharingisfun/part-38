Still damn good even w/out the DSD conversion.\n\n\nfoobar2000 1.1.13 / Dynamic Range Meter 1.1.1\nlog date: 2012-07-14 02:34:35\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAnalyzed: ? / ?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDR         Peak         RMS     Duration Track\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDR5       -0.07 dB   -10.62 dB      4:17 ?-01 - The Way Out Is Through\nDR6       -0.07 dB    -8.60 dB      4:49 ?-02 - Into the Void\nDR6       -0.07 dB    -8.34 dB      5:40 ?-03 - Where Is EverybodyÃ‚Â¿\nDR7       -0.07 dB   -10.19 dB      5:15 ?-04 - The Mark Has Been Made\nDR6       -0.07 dB    -7.60 dB      3:31 ?-05 - Please\nDR5       -0.07 dB    -7.67 dB      5:00 ?-06 - Starfuckers, Inc.\nDR7       -0.07 dB    -9.44 dB      2:31 ?-07 - Complication\nDR7       -0.07 dB    -8.78 dB      4:13 ?-08 - I'm Looking Forward to Joining You, Finally\nDR7       -0.07 dB    -8.69 dB      4:13 ?-09 - The Big Come Down\nDR7       -0.07 dB   -10.59 dB      2:46 ?-10 - Underneath It All\nDR9       -0.07 dB   -12.32 dB      6:34 ?-11 - Ripe (With Decay)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNumber of tracks:  11\nOfficial DR value: DR6\n\nSamplerate:        96000 Hz\nChannels:          2\nBits per sample:   24\nBitrate:           4608 kbps\nCodec:             PCM\n\n\n\nenjoy :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d295852ceda49677a62b2aa664132895aa537c67","amp;dn":"Nine+Inch+Nails+-+The+Fragile+%28Right%29+-+CD+remaster+by+MC+Lurken","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d295852ceda49677a62b2aa664132895aa537c67","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,149,133,44,237,164,150,119,166,43,42,166,100,19,40,149,170,83,124,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
