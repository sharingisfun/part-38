Together with Volume I in this series, this book provides comprehensive coverage of nonlinear signal and image processing techniques. Nonlinear Biomedical Signal Processing: Volume II combines analytical and biological expertise in the original mathematical simulation and modeling of physiological systems. Detailed discussions of the analysis of steady-state and dynamic systems, discrete-time system theory, and discrete modeling of continuous-time systems are provided. Biomedical examples include the analysis of the respiratory control system, the dynamics of cardiac muscle and the cardiorespiratory function, and neural firing patterns in auditory and vision systems. Examples include relevant MATLABÂ® and Pascal programs.\r\nTopics covered include:\r\n\r\nNonlinear dynamics\r\nBehavior and estimation\r\nModeling of biomedical signals and systems\r\nHeart rate variability measures, models, and signal assessments\r\nOrigin of chaos in cardiovascular and gastric myoelectrical activity\r\nMeasurement of spatio-temporal dynamics of human epileptic seizures\r\nA valuable reference book for medical researchers, medical faculty, and advanced graduate students, it is also essential reading for practicing biomedical engineers. Nonlinear Biomedical Signal Processing, Volume II is an excellent companion to Dr. Akay's Nonlinear Biomedical Signal Processing, Volume I: Fuzzy Logic, Neural Networks, and New Algorithms","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56a006248b07637ce9549729c359bbcd44fa2521","amp;dn":"Nonlinear+Biomedical+Signal+Processing+Vol.+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56a006248b07637ce9549729c359bbcd44fa2521","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,160,6,36,139,7,99,124,233,84,151,41,195,89,187,205,68,250,37,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
