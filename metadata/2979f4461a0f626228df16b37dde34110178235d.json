He discovered that certain mushrooms are high in antioxidants, including a very potent one called L-Ergothioneine that humans can't manufacture in their bodies. The ancient Chinese were among the first to use mushrooms and other plants for their health-sustaining values. \n\nSome of the more exotic mushrooms have the highest levels of antioxidants, including the Reishi from China, Cordyceps grown in Tibet, and the Antrodia from Taiwan, he stated, adding that antioxidants can help reduce inflammation in the body that is associated with many diseases, such as cancer. Tests have also shown that certain mushrooms can be helpful for diabetics and reduce their need for insulin and oral diabetic drugs, Hausman detailed. \n\nMany people have low levels of Vitamin D and could benefit from mushrooms that offer a natural source of this compound, he said. There may also be an upcoming breakthrough in treatment for Alzheimer's involving mushrooms high in Vitamin D, he shared. Interestingly, Hausman noted that dried mushrooms retain their nutritive value-- &quot;it's the only biologic food that allows total removal of water, without destroying any of its components,&quot; he said. \n\nRods &amp; UFOs\nLast hour guest, filmmaker Jose Escamilla talked about his newest film project, UFO, The Greatest Story Ever Denied (trailer), as well as his discovery and research into &quot;rods,&quot; purported flying life forms that he's caught on camera. He noted that a lot of intriguing aerial footage is being captured on infrared cameras-- some of this can be viewed on the World Infrared Sky Alliance'sChannel. \n\n\nWebsite(s):\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢nuflexonline.com\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢mushroomsolutions.com\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢tblnfilms.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2979f4461a0f626228df16b37dde34110178235d","amp;dn":"Coast+to+Coast+AM+-+05-12-10+-+Mushrooms+%26+Medical+Breakthroughs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2979f4461a0f626228df16b37dde34110178235d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,121,244,70,26,15,98,98,40,223,22,179,125,222,52,17,1,120,35,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
