In the interview with Mikal Gilmore, Dylan covers an incredible range of topics: John Lennon and Bruce Springsteen; what he really thought about the movies I'm Not There and Masked and Anonymous; being picked up by the police in New Jersey in 2009; and Ã¢â‚¬â€œ in a remarkable stretch Ã¢â‚¬â€œ his belief that he was &quot;transfigured&quot; around the time of his 1966 motorcycle accident. Dylan also, for the first time, strikes back at critics who have accused him of drawing too much from the work of others.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/bob-dylan-strikes-back-at-critics-20120912&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/bob-dylan-strikes-back-at-critics-20120912&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:86bca6a2480c4cb75db441872dea0fa4a6409ff0","amp;dn":"Rolling+Stone+-+September+14th%2C+2012+%28Bob+Dylan+Interview%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"86bca6a2480c4cb75db441872dea0fa4a6409ff0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,188,166,162,72,12,76,183,93,180,65,135,45,234,15,164,166,64,159,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
