Country purists may take offense at finding American Idol winner Carrie Underwood's debut album in the country section. An unabashedly manufactured commercial product, SOME HEARTS is the sound of mainstream country in the 2000s  heavily steeped in glossy pop. There's nothing downhome or roots-conscious about Underwood's voice or looks: she's the pretty blonde next door with a fine singing voice, but the powers that be have made her a country artist, and that's what the  public gets. None of this is to say that SOME HEARTS is not a good pop album. The  combination of Underwood's considerable gift and the slick, spot-on production of Dan Huff and Mark Bright makes for a fine package. Even on somewhat by-the-numbers tunes (like her smash hit &quot;Inside Your Heaven&quot;), Underwood sings with conviction, and she does well with both the ballads and the uptempo tracks. Idol viewers and fans of artists like Faith Hill and Shania Twain will want to check this out \n  \n Track Listing....: \n 01.Wasted [04:34] \n 02.Don't forget to remember me [04:00] \n 03.Some hearts [03:48] \ntake the wheel [03:47] \n 05.The night before [03:55] \n (life goes on) \n 06.Lessons learned [04:10] \n 07.Before he cheats [03:20] \n 08.Starts with goodbye [04:07] \n 09.I just can't live A lie [04:00] \n 10.We're young and beautiful [03:53] \n 11.That's where it is [03:35] \n 12.Whenever you remember [03:48] \n 13.I ain't in checotah anymore [03:21] \n 14.Inside your heaven [03:45] \n ____ \n \n 54:03 min \n 82,8 MB    \n\nCarrie_Underwood-Some_Hearts-(Retail)-2005-HHI\n                  ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5cab945e92431a85c8b14e23de5f4f4cec76d3c7","amp;dn":"Carrie_Underwood-Some_Hearts-%28Retail%29-2005-HHI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5cab945e92431a85c8b14e23de5f4f4cec76d3c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,171,148,94,146,67,26,133,200,177,78,35,222,95,79,76,236,118,211,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
