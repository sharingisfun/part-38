With a frontman whose voice is as comfortable with pop melodies as it is metalcore aggression, Sleeping with Sirens have a powerful weapon in their arsenal that few of their contemporaries can compete with. With more and more bands making the slide toward incorporating pop elements into their sound, it's refreshing to find one that can do it based on genuine vocal talent rather than just shoehorning some synths and dance beats into their sound, making an album like Feel a shining light in an increasingly homogenized post-hardcore landscape.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a99a6c12e5e0134a12aef882c02ca319699bec49","amp;dn":"Sleeping+With+Sirens+-+Feel+%282013%29+%5BFLAC%5D+BOCKSCAR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a99a6c12e5e0134a12aef882c02ca319699bec49","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,154,108,18,229,224,19,74,18,174,248,130,192,44,163,25,105,155,236,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
