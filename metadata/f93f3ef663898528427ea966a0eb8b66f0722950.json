With a focal date of 2050, this issue of AD asks when and how the design community can, should, and must be taking action. The discussion centres on shifts in the urban environment and an established way of life in a world of depleted natural resources and climate change. Featuring interviews with Paola Antonelli of MoMA and Tim Brown of IDEO, it includes contributions from thought leaders, such as Janine Benyus, Thomas Fisher, Daniel Kraft, Alex McDowell, Franz Oswold, and Mark Watts. High-profile designers like FutureCitiesLab, SHoP, and UrbanThinkTank, are featured as examples of forward thinking and innovation in the field, highlighting the need for Ã¢â‚¬â€ and possibility of Ã¢â‚¬â€ a shift in the global perspective. The discussion includes the challenges we face in creating a positive tomorrow, and the solutions that architecture and design can bring to the table","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f93f3ef663898528427ea966a0eb8b66f0722950","amp;dn":"2050%3A+Designing+Our+Tomorrow","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f93f3ef663898528427ea966a0eb8b66f0722950","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,63,62,246,99,137,133,40,66,126,169,102,160,235,139,102,240,114,41,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
