Unlike the previous volume, the new series is not set in the mainstream DC Universe continuity but instead features anthology style stories with rotating creative teams in the same format as the second Legends of the Dark Knight series. It is released as a digital-first comic with print publication to follow. The first story was to have been written by Orson Scott Card and drawn by Chris Sprouse and Karl Story. Card's participation in the project became an issue. DC Comics responded to a petition that he be dropped with a statement that it supported freedom of expression and that the personal views of individuals associated with the company were not the views of the company. Illustrator Chris Sprouse left the project due to the media attention and some comic book stores announced a boycott. Card's Superman story is now &quot;on hold&quot; and will not be included in either the scheduled print or digital issues and was replaced by a story written by Jeff Parker.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32850e4a3763eee576605945c0c432c452aeed02","amp;dn":"Adventures+of+Superman+018+%282013%29+%28digital%29+%28Minutemen-PhD%29.cbr+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32850e4a3763eee576605945c0c432c452aeed02","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,133,14,74,55,99,238,229,118,96,89,69,192,196,50,196,82,174,237,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
