As such, and\naccording to the laws where the individuals of heldigard reside,\nit is not my responsibility what others decides to do with\nthese releases. However, let it be said quite clearly;\n\n&quot;I DO NOT in any way condone the selling or redistribution\nof these cracks, this was NEVER my intention.&quot;\n\nheldigard does NOT take any responsibility of computer-loss\nor any data-errors that may occur from using these cracks.\nKeep in mind that you are using a third party solution to\nsomething we did not develop in the first place.\n\nDo note that the usage of these cracks are legal in most\ncountries outside the United States, IF and ONLY IF you own a\nfull copy of the program - then you may use these cracks\nfor backup purposes, and only that. It remains to be seen how\naffected you are of the End User License Agreements (EULAs).\nThey can't supersede domestic laws, remember that.\n\nAccording to the &quot;DMCA ACT&quot; in the Unites States, you have no\nrights to circumvent a copy protection. Beware, they will\npunish you harder than if you stole the shrinkwrapped software\nin a mall. Though heldigard's base of operation does not reside\nin the Unites States, and thus I am NOT bound to the\nUS legislations like:\n\n* No Electronic Theft Act\n* Digital Millenium Copyright Act\n* The Patriot Act\n* &lt;other US legislations&gt;\n\nYou should ALWAYS buy the software that you do use, or find\nsuitable Open Source replacements (as there are loads), I do!\n\nBy using these cracks you automatically agree\nto the written agreement above, and thus the responsibility\nregarding whatever you are affected by any EULAs is\nwith YOU and YOU only.\n\n+ G R E E T S +\n\nRATIBORUS,\nNOSFERATI87, JM287, HOTBIRD64, DEAGLES, MIKMIK38, QAD, CODYQX4, XINSO, NOVEMBER_RA1N \nCERBERUS8855, HUI.\n\nforums.mydigitallife.info\nru-board.com\npcbeta.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:260eefcfe029977111607635c41d709fe08179dd","amp;dn":"KMSpico+v9.0.5.20131110+RC+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"260eefcfe029977111607635c41d709fe08179dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,14,239,207,224,41,151,113,17,96,118,53,196,29,112,159,224,129,121,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
