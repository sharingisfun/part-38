Both CD's have stickers still on them \nsaying they were limited to 250 copies each. Like it or loath it, I don't care.\nReview comments found on the web below. \n\nEnjoy!\n\nPink Floyd ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Animals, Limited Edition Trance Remix\n\n1. Pigs On The Wing 1 (5:49) \t\n2. Dogs (22:45) \t\n3. Pigs (Three Different Ones) (20:28) \t\n4. Sheep (16:06) \t\n5. Pigs On The Wing 2 (6:38) \n\n&quot;This one is perhaps the worst of all the remixes available. There was much\npotential to re-interpret the songs in a new and creative fashion, but alas\nthis one is a dud. There is no substance to the interpretations of &quot;Dogs&quot;,\n&quot;Sheep&quot; and &quot;Pigs&quot; although &quot;Dogs&quot; works the best of the three. Some \nsamples of middle eastern music are interspersed throughout &quot;Pigs&quot; but don't\nwork very well: Annoyance city! &quot;Pigs on the Wing&quot; (pts 1&amp;2) work OK but are\nnothing special. Avoid this one: D&quot;\t\n\nPink Floyd ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Wish You Were Here, Limited Edition Trance Remix\n\n1. Shine On You Crazy Diamond (Fluffy Cloud Version) (16:55)\n2. Welcome to the Machine (New Age Version) (12:16)\n3. Have a Cigar (Take a Joint Version) (7:43)\n4. Wish You Were Here (Atmosfear Version) (6:13)\n5. Shine On You Crazy Diamond (Part 2 of a Journey Into Your Brain) (15:51)\n\n&quot;This remix is by far the best of all the remixes. As one would expect, \nthis album lends itself to ambient interpretation more than any other Floyd\nrelease. Both parts of &quot;Shine On You Crazy Diamond&quot; are brilliant excursions\ninto the outer limits with samples from The Orb's &quot;Little Fluffy Clouds&quot; \nscattered throughout. &quot;Welcome to the Machine&quot; and &quot;Have a Cigar&quot; are \npowerful interpretations with lots of heavy dance beats. &quot;Wish You Were \nHere&quot; is beautiful. I know I may be crucified here, but it is even better\nthan the original: nice spacey wind sounds echo on Gilmour's gorgeous vocals.\nA really pleasant listen. This remix definitely lends itself for headphones.\nA must have: A+&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:753420b84e66c8a3babba505b4bc803e53d492a4","amp;dn":"Pink+Floyd+-+Trance+Remix+2+Albums+%28MP3%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"753420b84e66c8a3babba505b4bc803e53d492a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,52,32,184,78,102,200,163,186,187,165,5,180,188,128,62,83,212,146,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
