NOW he goes EVEN DEEPER with Whitley Strieber on Dreamland! \n\nListen as Whitley asks him about a mutual friend who saw David 35 years ago looking EXACTLY as he does today. So has David Lewis Anderson traveled in time? One thing he's very clear about: time travel IS possible, and he's on a crusade to inform the public about this startling new reality. In this interview with Whitley Strieber, he tells us just how far time travel research has gone, and what it means for our lives and our future. \n\nHe delivers a ringing call for more openness in what is arguably the most provocative and dangerous scientific research ever undertaken. It seems more and more possible that the past could indeed be restitched by time travelers, but what might the consequences be? Frighteningly, they would probably be able to change our world without our knowing it. We could find ourselves living in a new reality of somebody else's making, without even knowing what we have lost. \n\nOr has that already happened? \n\nThis is Whitley Strieber at his provocative best, interviewing a brilliant and enigmatic man, a scientist at the far edge of science. \n\nDavid Lewis Anderson's website is AndersonInstitute.com. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e2e9f3c611d63b7849970e2dd434c8f17ff39a9","amp;dn":"Dreamland+-+Feb+6+2010+-+David+Anderson+-+Meet+a+Time+Traveler","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e2e9f3c611d63b7849970e2dd434c8f17ff39a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,46,159,60,97,29,99,183,132,153,112,226,221,67,76,143,23,255,57,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
