Jenny is bright, pretty, hard working but also naturally gifted. The only problems her \nfather may perceive in her life is her issue with learning Latin, and her dating a boy named Graham, who is nice but socially awkward. \nJenny's life changes after she meets David Goldman, a man over twice her age. David goes out of his way to show Jenny and her family \nthat his interest in her is not improper and that he wants solely to expose her to cultural activities which she enjoys.

However, Jenny slowly learns more about David, and by association Danny and Helen, \nand specifically how they make their money.
