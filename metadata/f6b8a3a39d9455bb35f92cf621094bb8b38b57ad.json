After graduating from college, she takes a job working as a summer girl for the ReedsÃ¢â‚¬â€œÃ¢â‚¬â€œa wealthy, accomplished family that personifies her American dream. Her summer takes an unexpected turn when the ReedsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ eldest son Tyler, the star quarterback for Notre Dame, shows up and turns her life upside down.\n\nAn ambitious young woman with a wry sense of humor, Chloe never imagined herself as the type to succumb to the looks and charms of the hometown hero, but she falls hard for Tyler, and is devastated when they part ways at the end of the summer. As she heads off to law school, Chloe tries to convince herself this was just a fling, but she canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t quite get over him. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not until Tyler contacts her out of the blue late one winter night that everything changes. \n\nAfter doing everything in her power to build the perfect life, Chloe soon learns that there are things beyond her control. She must draw on inner reserves of strength as her life takes unpredictableÃ¢â‚¬â€and sometimes heartbreakingÃ¢â‚¬â€twists and turns, and she finds herself faced with decisions she never thought sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d have to make. Poignant, heartfelt, and emotional, Finding Bliss is a reminder that you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have to live a fairytale life in order to have a happy ending.\n\n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f6b8a3a39d9455bb35f92cf621094bb8b38b57ad","amp;dn":"Finding+Bliss+by+Dina+Silver+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f6b8a3a39d9455bb35f92cf621094bb8b38b57ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,184,163,163,157,148,85,187,53,249,44,246,33,9,75,184,179,139,87,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
