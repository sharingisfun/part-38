Behind their actions is a controlling intelligence known as 'Darkness', who intends to drag New York back into the warp Ã¢â‚¬â€œ destroying it utterly! \n\nAir strikes, ground assaults and WMDs have all failed to stop the swarming forces from beyond. All that remains is a single hope: a shadowy ex-special forces soldier, enhanced for combat and known only as 'Chainsaw Warrior'. Equipped with all the latest high-tech armaments, he must battle his way through to the trans-dimensional ground-zero and defeat Darkness. \n\nNot only are there swarms of zombies, mutants, traps, Chaos Agents and other twisted denizens between him and Darkness, time is the enemy too! Only an hour remains to save New York before it is torn from our world forever. \n\nFirst published as a solo boardgame in 1987, it has been updated, translated and re-engineered for the digital generation. In Chainsaw Warrior it's just you against both the clock and a tide of evil! Can you prevail where all others have failed? You only have 60 minutes to save New York!\n\nMore info:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aurochdigital.chainsawwarrior&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aurochdigital.chainsawwarrior&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nInstructions:\n\n1.Install the APK\n2.Copy 'com.aurochdigital.chainsawwarrior' folder to 'Sdcard/Android/Obb'\n3.Launch the Game\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a59fc8679979ab5b1c82484a72b7e6ecd6d7a049","amp;dn":"Chainsaw+Warrior+v1.1d","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a59fc8679979ab5b1c82484a72b7e6ecd6d7a049","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,159,200,103,153,121,171,91,28,130,72,74,114,183,230,236,214,215,160,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
