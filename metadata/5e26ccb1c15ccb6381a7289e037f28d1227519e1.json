It can change ringer mode to silent or vibrate for a specified amount of time. It can also start when the silent or vibrate mode is changed(check the settings).\n\nTHIS DOES HAVE ADS. However, if anyone wants to use it, let me know in the comments and I will upload the ad free apk.\n\nBasically, I just want to get some feedback whether the app works on others' devices, and what other improvements can be done. Thanks.\n\nPermissions Explained -\n\nInternet Access - Only for the ads\n\nStart at boot - To ensure app works even after reboot.
