According to Gabriel, the initial recording was finished in three years during the early '90s, but &quot;the tapes were left in a mess and it's taken this long to sort out.&quot; Producer Stephen Hague was finally called in to sort out the project.\nGuests on the album include SinÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©ad O'Connor, Karl Wallinger (of World Party), Natacha Atlas, and Papa Wemba. Gabriel takes the lead vocals on several tracks on the album. A mix of western, African, and Asian musicians are also included.\n\nTrack Listing:\n1. &quot;Whole Thing (Original Mix)&quot; (featuring Francis Bebey, Alex Faku, Tim Finn, Peter Gabriel, Karl Wallinger, Andy White)\n2. &quot;Habibe&quot; (featuring Natacha Atlas, Hossam Ramzy, Neil Sparkes)\n3. &quot;Shadow&quot; (featuring Juan CaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±izares, Papa Wemba)\n4. &quot;altus silva&quot;[6] (featuring Joseph Arthur, Ronan Browne, Deep Forest, James McNally, Iarla ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å“ LionÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡ird, Vernon Reid)\n5. &quot;Exit Through You&quot; (featuring Joseph Arthur, Peter Gabriel, Karl Wallinger)\n6. &quot;Everything Comes From You&quot; (featuring Richard Evans, Joji Hirota, Sevara Nazarkhan, Sinead OÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Connor, Guo Yue)\n7. &quot;Burn You Up, Burn You Down&quot; (featuring Billy Cobham, Peter Gabriel, The Holmes Brothers, Wendy Melvoin, Arona NÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢diaye, Jah Wobble)\n8. &quot;Forest&quot; (featuring Levon Minassian, Arona NÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Diaye, Vernon Reid, Hukwe Zawose)\n9. &quot;Rivers&quot; (featuring Vernon Reid, MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡rta SebestyÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©n, Karl Wallinger)\n10. &quot;Jijy&quot; (featuring Arona NÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Diaye, Rossy, Jah Wobble)\n11. &quot;Big Blue Ball&quot; (featuring Peter Gabriel, Manu KatchÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©, Karl Wallinger)\n\nDue to the amazing dynamic range present in the songs of this album, and the very nature of the songs themselves, anything less than lossless FLAC is simply an insult.\n\nI will 'double seed' this to 3:1 (a computer at home, as well as one when I'm at work).
