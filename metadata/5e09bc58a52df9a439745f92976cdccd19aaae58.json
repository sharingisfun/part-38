Her cantankerous nature, though, has made her few friends, excepting her trusting, sensitive partner Eric\nMatthews (Benjamin Bratt). However, her true abilities are put to the test when she is called upon to infiltrate a Miss United States pageant after a terrorist threatens to bomb it. Gracie, who prides herself on her toughness, must now feminize her behavior to effectively participate in the pageant with the aid of Victor Melling (Michael Caine), a pompous consultant who dreams of whisking away Gracie&amp;#039;s past self and creating &quot;Gracie Lou Freebush&quot; for an appreciative, all-American audience. After her arduous conversion, Gracie must play the role of beauty queen and FBI agent, and try not to blow her undercover outfit.\n\nRegion: PAL\n   \nLanguage: Dolby Digital 5.1: English. Spanish.
