Originating separately in both ancient Greece and India, the concept of the atom persisted for centuries, despite often running afoul of conventional thinking. Until the twentieth century, no direct evidence for atoms existed. Today it is possible to actually observe atoms using a scanning tunneling microscope. The book begins with the story of the earliest atomists - the ancient Greek philosophers Leucippus, Democritus, and Epicurus, and the Latin poet Lucretius. As the author notes, the idea of elementary particles as the foundation of reality had many opponents throughout history - from Aristotle to Christian theologians and even some nineteenth-century chemists and philosophers. While theists today accept that the evidence for the atomic theory of matter is overwhelming, they reject the atheistic implications of that theory.\n\nabout author \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/authors/1335712374p8/111011.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/authors/1335712374p8/111011.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nVictor John Stenger is an American particle physicist, outspoken atheist and author, now active in philosophy and popular religious skepticism.\n\nAs of June 2010, he has published nine books for general audiences on physics, quantum mechanics, cosmology, philosophy, religion, atheism, and pseudoscience, the latest of which include The New Atheism: Taking a Stand for Science and Reason, which was released in September 2009, and The Fallacy of Fine-Tuning: How the Universe is Not Designed for Humanity (2011).\n\n`~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`\n  SEED PLEASE , LET OTHERS GET IT TOO. \n `~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d72a398cf364e08565d6121ec6eefe4b6647ecb","amp;dn":"God+and+the+atom","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d72a398cf364e08565d6121ec6eefe4b6647ecb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,114,163,152,207,54,78,8,86,93,97,33,236,110,239,228,182,100,126,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
