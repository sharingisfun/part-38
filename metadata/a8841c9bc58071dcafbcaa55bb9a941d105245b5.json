The album marked a minor turning point in the evolution of the LennonÃ¢â‚¬â€œMcCartney partnership, John Lennon particularly now showing interest in composing songs of a more autobiographical nature. &quot;I'm a Loser&quot; shows Lennon for the first time coming under the influence of Bob Dylan, whom he met for the first time in New York while on tour, on 28 August 1964. \n\nBeatles for Sale did not produce a single for the UK Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the non-album tracks &quot;I Feel Fine&quot; and &quot;She's a Woman&quot; performed that role. Nevertheless, that coupling was followed up in the United States by &quot;Eight Days a Week&quot;, which became their seventh number one in March 1965.\n\nThe album hit the UK number one spot and retained that position for 11 of the 46 weeks that it spent in the Top 20. Beatles for Sale did not surface as a regular album in the US until 1987. In its place was Beatles '65 which featured eight songs from Beatles for Sale, plus the A and B-side of &quot;I Feel Fine&quot; and &quot;I'll Be Back&quot; from the UK's A Hard Day's Night album. Beatles '65 enjoyed a nine week run at the top of the US charts beginning in January 1965.\n\nOn 26 February 1987, Beatles for Sale was officially released on Compact Disc (catalogue number CDP 7 46438 2), as were three other of The Beatles' albums, Please Please Me, With the Beatles and A Hard Day's Night. Almost 23 years after its original release, the album charted in the United Kingdom for a fortnight in 1987. Having been available only as an import in the US in the past, the album was also issued domestically in the US on LP and cassette on 21 July 1987. Even though this album was recorded on four-track tape, the CD version issued in 1987 was available only in mono.\n\nThis album has been digitally remastered using the latest technology (along with the rest of The Beatles' catalogue) and was reissued on CD in stereo for the first time on 9 September 2009\n\n2009 STEREO REMASTER [320k MP3]\n\n01. \t&quot;No Reply&quot;   \tLennon \t2:15\n02. \t&quot;I'm a Loser&quot;   \tLennon \t2:31\n03. \t&quot;Baby's in Black&quot;   \tLennon and McCartney \t2:02\n04. \t&quot;Rock and Roll Music&quot; (Chuck Berry) \tLennon \t2:32\n05. \t&quot;I'll Follow the Sun&quot;   \tMcCartney \t1:46\n06. \t&quot;Mr. Moonlight&quot; (Roy Lee Johnson) \tLennon \t2:33\n07. \t&quot;Kansas City/Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey!&quot; (Stoller/Richard McCartney \t2:33\n08. \t&quot;Eight Days a Week&quot;   \tLennon and McCartney \t2:44\n09. \t&quot;Words of Love&quot; (Buddy Holly) \tLennon and McCartney \t2:12\n10. \t&quot;Honey Don't&quot; (Carl Perkins) \tStarr \t2:55\n11. \t&quot;Every Little Thing&quot;   \tLennon and McCartney \t2:01\n12. \t&quot;I Don't Want to Spoil the Party&quot;   \tLennon, with McCartney \t2:33\n13. \t&quot;What You're Doing&quot;   \tMcCartney \t2:30\n14. \t&quot;Everybody's Trying to Be My Baby&quot; (Perkins) \tHarrison \t2:23","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8841c9bc58071dcafbcaa55bb9a941d105245b5","amp;dn":"The+Beatles+-+Beatles+For+Sale+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a8841c9bc58071dcafbcaa55bb9a941d105245b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,132,28,155,197,128,113,220,175,188,170,85,187,154,148,29,16,82,69,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
