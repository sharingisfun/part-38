It was originally the Escorts, but it eventually evolved into the Allman Joys. Duane Allman quit highschool to focus his days at home practicing guitar. They auditioned for Bob Dylan&amp;#039;s producer, Bob Johnston, at Columbia Records, backing a girl trio called The Sandpipers. In true Beatlesque style, Johnson was more interested in the girls... Eventually, they went on to form Hour Glass and then the Allman Brothers Band.\n\nMusician Credits\n\n    * Gregg Allman (Organ)\n    * Duane Allman (Lead guitar)\n    * Bobby Dennis (Rhythm Guitar)\n    * Jack Jackson (Rhythm Guitar)\n    * Ralph Bollinger (Bass guitar)\n    * Tommy Amato (Drums)\n    * Ronnie Wilkins (Piano)\n\n1.
