There's nobody else like him. Part P.T. Barnum, part Indiana Jones, part Mick and Keith, Billy's the best there is at sniffing out rare, fascinating treasures...and then making a deal to buy them.\n\nIn this new and exciting series, Billy and his fiancÃƒÂ© Jessica trip across continents, pulling off some of the biggest deals in the wild and crazy world of buying and selling ancient tribal art and artifacts. Billy collects 2000 year-old Egyptian mummies, 16th century German torture instruments,and has one of the largest collections of South American shrunken human heads in the world. Join us on Billy's one-of-a-kind road trips around the world as we tag along to watch him uncover rare treasures worth thousands, even millions and then snatch them up before the competition catches on.\n\nHis investment? To play this game takes millions...and Billy's willing to risk it all IF the treasure he's hunting is the real deal. He's even re-mortgaged his house, a sprawling, living museum packed with bizarre artifacts, at least a half a dozen times, so that he can buy low and sell fast. But, there are never any guarantees. This isn't Wall Street or even Main Street. The market for mummies or shrunken heads is a little limited, with fakes and forgeries, rogues and rascals everywhere! For those with a love for history, reflected in rare, ancient artifacts or exotic tribal art, the competition is intense and the payoff, priceless.\n\n1 x 1 Pilot\n1 x 2 Egyptian Auction\n1 x 3 Shrunken head, Movie Memorabilia\n1 x 4 Nuremberg Torture Tools\n1 x 5 Mystery Body\n1 x 6 Kono Mask, Samurai Sword, 1st Autopsy, Guillotine\n1 x 7 Red Bull, Two-Headed Cow, Tooth Sign, Haida Art\n1 x 8 God Staff, Another Paris Mummy\n\n\n\n\n--- File Information ---\nFile Name : Treasure.Trader.S01E01.HDTV.x264-CLDD.mp4\nFormat : MPEG-4 at 1 267 Kbps\nLength : 199 MiB for 21mn 59s 467ms\n\nVideo #0 : AVC at 1 102 Kbps\nAspect : 720 x 400 (1.800) at 23.976 fps\n\nAudio #0 : AAC at 161 Kbps\nInfos : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage : en","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c27803737f2fa2de2007388739aa232671012130","amp;dn":"Treasure.Trader.S01.HDTV.x264-CLDD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c27803737f2fa2de2007388739aa232671012130","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,120,3,115,127,47,162,222,32,7,56,135,57,170,35,38,113,1,33,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
