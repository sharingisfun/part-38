After years of underground existence, this brilliant novel is emerging as a classic of visionary writing and still remains Hawkes's only work devoted solely to American life. As a 'surrealist Western&quot; (Newsweek), and a violent and poetic portrayal of &quot;a landscape of sexual apathy&quot; (Albert J. Guerard), The Beetle Leg is a rich flight into the special vein of comedy that Hawkes had begun to exploit a decade before the popular acceptance of &quot;black humor.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:20bcd3fe3d0e0a465209310dbfc70527c78fc562","amp;dn":"Hawkes%2C+John+-+The+Beetle+Leg.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"20bcd3fe3d0e0a465209310dbfc70527c78fc562","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,188,211,254,61,14,10,70,82,9,49,13,191,199,5,39,199,143,197,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
