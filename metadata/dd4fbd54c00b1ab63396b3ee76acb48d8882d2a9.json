I bought this having only heard of about 6 bands on the album, so it was a introduction to many new artists, all of which have impressed me. The more popular songs blend in with the others perfectly, and I couldn't ask for a better mixture of old and new. The record companies have really done themselves a favour in releasing this album; it's certainly re-awakened my interest in guitar music again, and I cannot see that any fan of this kind of music will be disappointed here.\n\nDisc: 1\n1.
