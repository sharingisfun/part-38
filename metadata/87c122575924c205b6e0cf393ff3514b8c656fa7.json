Completed in AD 8, it is recognized as a masterpiece of Golden Age Latin literature. The most-read of all classical works during the Middle Ages, the Metamorphoses continues to exert a profound influence on Western culture. It also remains the favourite work of reference for Greek myth upon which Ovid based these tales, albeit often with stylistic adaptations.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87c122575924c205b6e0cf393ff3514b8c656fa7","amp;dn":"The+Metamorphoses","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87c122575924c205b6e0cf393ff3514b8c656fa7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,193,34,87,89,36,194,5,182,224,207,57,63,243,81,75,140,101,111,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
