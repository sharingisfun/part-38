The makers of the Buffy the Vampire Slayer theme music. The singers of an over-the-top ode to Van Halen. So cuddly, funny and nice, who couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t love them?\n\nYour mom, probably, if there hadnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t been a considerable amount of censorship and/or restraint in the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s formative years, as My EP shows. A collection of unreleased tracks that the now defunct My Records originally released, Honest DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s scratches up another four songs and re-releases this out-of-print collection. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll never look at Nerf Herder the same again.\n\nThe band still features its distinctly dorky sound. Singer Parry GrippÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s delivery is still as whiney as a freshman stuffed in a gym locker, and the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s light pop punk was never meant to do more than carry a bubblegum melody as a backdrop for the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s silly tales. This time around, however, the actÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not nearly a bunch of goofs much as a horde of frustrated computer nerds. Sexual content is upped considerably: Check Ã¢â‚¬Å“Love SandwichÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ for a not-so-subtle tune about a threesome, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Fight For Your Right To MasturbateÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ rips the Beasties as well as Internet porn, and Ã¢â‚¬Å“IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve Got a Boner For ChristmasÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ smacks of The Vandals without either Nerf HerderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wit or the VandalsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ snottiness. Other tracks cover vital topics such as paying homage to a sports bar (Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Sportsmen BarÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) and, clichÃƒÂ© of all clichÃƒÂ©s, reveling in celebrity crushes (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Nikki WebsterÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½).\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b55d969367c3d8bc62d907e266d8d71cdd92c1b","amp;dn":"NERF+HERDER+-+MY+E+P++%28Genre%3A+NERDCORE%21%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b55d969367c3d8bc62d907e266d8d71cdd92c1b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,85,217,105,54,124,61,139,198,45,144,126,38,109,141,113,205,217,44,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
