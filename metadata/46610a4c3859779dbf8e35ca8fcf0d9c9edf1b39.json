This latest version of Resident Evil Revelations will also deliver additional content including a terrifying new enemy, extra difficulty mode, integration with ResidentEvil.net and improvements to Raid Mode. Raid Mode, which was first introduced to the series in the original version of Resident Evil Revelations, sees gamers play online in co-op mode or alone in single player taking on the hordes of enemies across a variety of missions whilst leveling up characters and earning weapon upgrades. New weapons, skill sets, and playable characters including Hunk, take the Raid Mode experience to new depths.\n\nThe critically acclaimed survival horror title takes players back to the events that took place between Resident Evil Ã‚Â® 4 and Resident Evil Ã‚Â® 5, revealing the truth about the T-Abyss virus. Resident Evil Revelations features series favorites Jill Valentine and Chris Redfield, plus their respective BSAA partners - Parker Luciani and Jessica Sherawat. The action begins on board a supposedly abandoned cruise ship, the 'Queen Zenobia', where horrors lurk around every corner, before players head for the mainland and the devastated city of Terragrigia. With limited ammo and weapons available, the race is on to survive the horror of Resident Evil Revelations.\n\n\n\n# # System requirements:\n\nMinimum Requirements:\n\nOS: Windows Ã‚Â® XP\n\nProcessor: Intel Ã‚Â® Core Ã¢â€žÂ¢ 2 Duo 2.4Ghz or better, AMD Athlon Ã¢â€žÂ¢ X2 2.8 Ghz or better\n\nMemory: 2 GB RAM\n\nGraphics: NVIDIA Ã‚Â® GeForce Ã‚Â® 8800GTS or better, ATI Radeon Ã¢â€žÂ¢ HD3850 or better\n\nDirectX Ã‚Â®: 9.0c\n\nHard Drive: 8 GB HD space\n\nSound: DirectSound supported with DirectX9.0c or better.\n\n\n\n# # Installation:\n\n1.
