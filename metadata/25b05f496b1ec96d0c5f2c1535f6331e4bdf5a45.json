The series, which was produced in association with 20th Century Fox Television for CBS, follows a team of doctors and support staff stationed at the &quot;4077th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital&quot; in Uijeongbu, South Korea during the Korean War. The show's title sequence features an instrumental-only version of &quot;Suicide Is Painless&quot;, the theme song from the original film. The show was created after an attempt to film the original book's sequel, M*A*S*H Goes to Maine, failed. The television series is the best-known version of the M*A*S*H works, and one of the highest-rated shows in U.S. television history.\r\n\r\nThe series premiered in the U.S. on September 17, 1972, and ended on February 28, 1983, with the finale, &quot;Goodbye, Farewell and Amen&quot;, becoming the most-watched and highest-rated single television episode in U.S. television history at the time, with a record-breaking 125 million viewers (60.2 rating and 77 share), according to the New York Times. It had struggled in its first season and was at risk of being cancelled. Season two of M*A*S*H placed it in a better time slot (airing after the popular All in the Family); the show became one of the top 10 programs of the year and stayed in the top 20 programs for the rest of its run. It is still broadcast in syndication on various television stations. The series, which depicted events occurring during a three-year military conflict, spanned 256 episodes and lasted 11 seasons. The Korean conflict lasted 1,128 days, meaning each episode of the series would have averaged almost four and a half days of real time. Many of the stories in the early seasons are based on tales told by real MASH surgeons who were interviewed by the production team. Like the movie, the series was as much an allegory about the Vietnam War (still in progress when the show began) as it was about the Korean War.\r\n\r\nThe episodes &quot;Abyssinia, Henry&quot; and &quot;The Interview&quot; were ranked number 20 and number 80, respectively, on TV Guide's 100 Greatest Episodes of All Time in 1997. In 2002, M*A*S*H was ranked number 25 on TV Guide's 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time. In 2013, the Writers Guild of America ranked it as the fifth-best written TV series ever and TV Guide ranked it as the eighth-greatest show of all time.\r\n\r\nGeneral\r\nComplete name                            : D:TorrentMASH - Stagione 02 - Episodi 241 - Divided We Stand.avi\r\nFormat                                   : AVI\r\nFormat/Info                              : Audio Video Interleave\r\nFile size                                : 300 MiB\r\nDuration                                 : 24 min\r\nOverall bit rate                         : 1 677 kb/s\r\nWriting application                      : FairUse Wizard - http://fairusewizard.com\r\nWriting library                          : The best and REALLY easy backup tool\r\n\r\nVideo\r\nID                                       : 0\r\nFormat                                   : MPEG-4 Visual\r\nFormat settings, BVOP                    : 2\r\nFormat settings, QPel                    : No\r\nFormat settings, GMC                     : No warppoints\r\nFormat settings, Matrix                  : Default (H.263)\r\nMuxing mode                              : Packed bitstream\r\nCodec ID                                 : DX50\r\nCodec ID/Hint                            : DivX 5\r\nDuration                                 : 24 min\r\nBit rate                                 : 1 475 kb/s\r\nWidth                                    : 720 pixels\r\nHeight                                   : 528 pixels\r\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 4:3\r\nFrame rate                               : 25.000 FPS\r\nColor space                              : YUV\r\nChroma subsampling                       : 4:2:0\r\nBit depth                                : 8 bits\r\nScan type                                : Progressive\r\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\r\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)                       : 0.155\r\nStream size                              : 264 MiB (88%)\r\nWriting library                          : DivX 6.8.5 (UTC 2009-08-20)\r\n\r\nAudio\r\nID                                       : 1\r\nFormat                                   : AC-3\r\nFormat/Info                              : Audio Coding 3\r\nMode extension                           : CM (complete main)\r\nFormat settings, Endianness              : Big\r\nCodec ID                                 : 2000\r\nDuration                                 : 24 min\r\nBit rate mode                            : Constant\r\nBit rate                                 : 192 kb/s\r\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\r\nChannel positions                        : Front: L R\r\nSampling rate                            : 48.0 kHz\r\nFrame rate                               : 31.250 FPS (1536 spf)\r\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\r\nStream size                              : 34.3 MiB (11%)\r\nAlignment                                : Split accross interleaves\r\nInterleave, duration                     : 40  ms (1.00 video frame)\r\nInterleave, preload duration             : 500  ms\r\n\r\nSottotitoli non presenti","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:25b05f496b1ec96d0c5f2c1535f6331e4bdf5a45","amp;dn":"MASH+-+S02E24+-+DVD+RIP+-+1972+ITA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"25b05f496b1ec96d0c5f2c1535f6331e4bdf5a45","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,176,95,73,107,30,201,109,12,95,44,21,53,246,51,30,75,223,90,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
