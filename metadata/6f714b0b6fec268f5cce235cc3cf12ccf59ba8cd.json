Phil Dick wishes heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d never stopped writing. Phil Dick wishes he could do his work. Phil Dick wishes he didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have to work. Phil Dick wishes the robot copsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ horse was his friend. Phil Dick wishes he didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have to have any friends.\n\nPhil Dick does drugs, but not at work. Except sometimes. Phil Dick hates computer games, but he makes them for a job. Phil Dick hates the Beatles, but got on the backstage list for their show at Candlestick Park. Phil Dick hates Bruce Lee, but he has to make it through dinner with that preening rock star. Phil Dick has a lot of harsh judgments about everybody else for someone who has a wife and a mistress and a total inability to pay his bills or generally handle his shit.\n\nPhil Dick does drugs, but not at work. Except all the time. Phil Dick canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get any work done, because he canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t stop reading about the mystery of the Lead Masks, like everybody else with a HeadyÃ¢â€žÂ¢, or wondering where the hell the Grey Ghost has gone.\n\nFinally, utterly failing at life on every level has got to feel like the end of the world. Right?\n\nPhil Dick wonders how itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s going to feel.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f714b0b6fec268f5cce235cc3cf12ccf59ba8cd","amp;dn":"666ties+-+1966%3A+Untitled+Bruce+Lee%2FPhil+Dick+Project","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f714b0b6fec268f5cce235cc3cf12ccf59ba8cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,113,75,11,111,236,38,143,92,206,35,92,195,207,18,204,245,155,168,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
