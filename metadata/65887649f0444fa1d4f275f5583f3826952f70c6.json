It retains the flat design that was introduced along with Microsoft design language, albeit a few modifications to the layout are made, in order to conform with the design of Microsoft Office Mobile.\r\nOffice 2016 has three themes. The default theme, known as &quot;colorful&quot;, features a solid colour on the top band of the ribbon, corresponding to the colour of the Office app being used, for example, a solid dark blue is featured prominently in Microsoft Word. The theme had been described as useful in making the tab headings more distinct.\r\nIn addition, both the &quot;white&quot; and &quot;dark grey&quot; themes from Office 2013 are available as well, though, no new backgrounds have been added, nor existing backgrounds removed.\r\n\r\nIn addition, Microsoft has removed the ability to run parallel versions of Office with the 2016 release.\r\nPart of the installer will search and remove any previous version and not permit the operation of older components. e.g. an older version of Outlook 2013/2010 with Publisher 2016.\r\n\r\nIn other words, don't mix Office versions.\r\n\r\nYou can use Microsoft FixIt Tools to manually uninstall / remove / delete previous Office versions\r\n\r\n*** Uninstall Office 2003, Office 2007 or Office 2010 https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/971179\r\n*** Uninstall Office 2016, Office 2013 or Office 365 https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Uninstall-Office-2016-Office-2013-or-Office-365-from-a-Windows-computer-9dd49b83-264a-477a-8fcc-2fdf5dbf61d8?ui=en-US\r\n\r\nThis should remove all traces of Office from the system.\r\n\r\nSystem requirements\r\n\r\n- Memory: 2 GB RAM\r\n- Hard disk: 3.0 GB available disk space\r\n- Display: 1280 x 800  screen resolution\r\n- OS: any version of Windows 10/8.1/8/7 SP1 + Windows 10 Server, Server 2012 R2/2012/2008 R2\r\n- .NET version: .NET 3.5 required.
