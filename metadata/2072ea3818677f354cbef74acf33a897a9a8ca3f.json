The label is led by rapper/producer M3NYFAC3Z and includes rapper/producer &amp; brother Lord Freeze. M3NYFAC3Z has said they are currently looking for artists to join the label (as of 2/14/2009). M3NYFAC3Z is best known for his controversial,dark lyrical content that have many comparing him to known rappers Tech N9ne and Eminem.\n\n&quot;The Inception&quot; gets professionally critiqued by veteran journalist Alex Henderson\n\nAt times, the production on this EP is downright lush.  That is especially true on Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hello AgainÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Reign,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ both of which are melodic and polished in a way that brings to mind Dr. DreÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lavish productions.  Dre, it should be noted, has had a major impact on the way hip-hop is produced.  Back in the mid- to late 1980s and early 1990s, many hip-hoppers (especially on the East Coast) favored raw, edgy, tough, rugged productions that consisted primarily of drum machines, samples and some scratching.  But Dr. Dre favored a much sleeker and more melodic approach, and after the post-N.W.A Dre came out with 1993Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s enormously influential The Chronic, countless hip-hop producers went for sleekness and got away from the type of rawness that had characterized New York City-based producers like Marley Marl and DJ Mark the 45 King.  DreÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s impact was huge, and that Dre-minded polish is very much a part of the production on Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hello AgainÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Reign.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½  The Dre influence also asserts itself on the eerie, hypnotic Ã¢â‚¬Å“War.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nBut production-wise, Dre is not M3NYFAC3ZÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ only influence.  On Ã¢â‚¬Å“HorrorscopeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ill Wicked,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ M3NYFAC3ZÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ use of synthesizers hints at European techno.  The production on Ã¢â‚¬Å“HorrorscopeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ill WickedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is mainly hip-hop, but with a hint of techno.  However, neither Ã¢â‚¬Å“HorrorscopeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ nor Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ill WickedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is as abrasive as European techno is known for being.  M3NYFAC3Z is going for funky on  Ã¢â‚¬Å“HorrorscopeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ill Wicked,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ but he isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t going for the type of brutal, crushing sensory assault that European techno is known for.  And hip-hop heads who donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t necessarily care for techno and other types of rave music will still be able to get into those tunes.  In other words, Ã¢â‚¬Å“HorrorscopeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ill WickedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ still sound like hip-hop (not like the soundtrack to a rave).\n\nUnlike many of todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rapper/producers, M3NYFAC3Z doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t bring in a female singer to perform choruses and sweeten things up.  Even on the most melodic parts of The Inception, he doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t go down that path.  The sleekness on Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hello AgainÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“ReignÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ comes from the melodies, not from some studio singer who is trying to sound like BeyoncÃƒÂ© Knowles or Jill Scott (or on some of the more rock-influenced hip-hop albums, perhaps Sarah McLachlan, Natalie Imbruglia or Jewel).   Vocally, The Inception is about rapping, not singing.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2072ea3818677f354cbef74acf33a897a9a8ca3f","amp;dn":"M3NYFAC3Z+-+The+Inception+%282012%29+%2A%2AFOR+FANS+OF+TECH+N9NE+%2F+EMINE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2072ea3818677f354cbef74acf33a897a9a8ca3f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,114,234,56,24,103,127,53,76,190,247,74,207,51,168,151,169,168,202,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
