The Cardinal&amp;#039;s Revenge   7/16/2000\nStilled trapped in the time of the Three Musketeers, Rebecca is mistaken for Madame D&amp;#039;Urfe, an assassin hired to kill King Louis XIII. Jules and Phileas must persuade the Three Musketeers to reunite to rescue Rebecca, and save the King by defeating Richelieu. Of the Musketeers, Athos is dead and the other two are relucant, but are swayed to join. Porthos is a dead-ringer for Dumas in the 19th century. Adding further confusion, Richelieu is a twin for Fogg, Louis XIII for Jules, and D&amp;#039;Urfe for Rebecca. Apparently they have not just traveled in time, but into a parallel dimension of some sort. \n\n6. The Eyes of Lazarus   7/23/2000\nThe evil spirit of a dead mad anarchist, Lazarus, takes possession of Passepartout at a seance for Passepartout&amp;#039;s recently-deceased Aunt Louisa. Lazarus, who died at the hands of Phileas, is intent on returning the favor. When Passepartout is thought mad and committed to an asylum, the spirit of Lazarus passes to Rebecca.\n\nXviD/576x320/42 min\n\nLeave a comment if you&amp;#039;d like to see more! :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:226fc12f62059f2f0c93617db48ceaaf4d102625","amp;dn":"THE+SECRET+ADVENTURES+OF+JULES+VERNE+5-6+%5Bretr%3Ftv%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"226fc12f62059f2f0c93617db48ceaaf4d102625","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,111,193,47,98,5,159,47,12,147,97,125,180,140,234,175,77,16,38,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
