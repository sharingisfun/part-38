'Music of Jimi Hendrix' is a glimpse at that project, but it's not fully developed enough to give a real sense of what it should have been. The readings are perfunctory, lacking the sensuous, assaultive experience that Hendrix created. Evans only arranged two of the eight tracks. Japanese guitarist Ryo Kawasaki does provide some good moments, however.&quot; ***\n- Mikal Gilmore, Rolling Stone","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:adb50a78720ab47bfbc46bd66d2b73835c568475","amp;dn":"The+Gil+Evans+Orchestra+-+Plays+the+Music+of+Jimi+Hendrix+%281974+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"adb50a78720ab47bfbc46bd66d2b73835c568475","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,181,10,120,114,10,180,123,251,196,107,214,109,43,115,131,92,86,132,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
