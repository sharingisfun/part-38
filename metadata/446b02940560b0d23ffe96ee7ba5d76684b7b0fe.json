For some, this might not be the time to take on a new creative pursuit - but for McBride there couldn't have been a better time.\n\nIn order to dig deep into that creativity, she teamed up with chart-topping producer and virtuoso guitarist, Dann Huff. Admittedly, she struggled to find inspiration on some of her latest releases, but co-producing with someone new forced McBride out of her comfort zone and re-lit the fire within.\n\n&quot;I wanted to move forward, production-wise, which isn't always easy. I think it was time to find somebody with a different, fresh perspective on my music,&quot; explains McBride. &quot;I felt like I needed someone to help me do things a bit differently, and I instinctively felt Dann was right for the job.&quot; \n\nTen months later, she is releasing an album not categorized necessarily as a departure, but certainly something fresh and innovative. \n\n&quot;I'm so excited about this music and this time in my life,&quot; says McBride. &quot;Creatively I have a renewed energy and I feel like this album reflects that.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:446b02940560b0d23ffe96ee7ba5d76684b7b0fe","amp;dn":"Martina+McBride+-+Shine+2009+KompletlyWyred+DHZ+Inc+Release","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"446b02940560b0d23ffe96ee7ba5d76684b7b0fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,107,2,148,5,96,176,210,63,254,150,238,123,165,215,102,132,183,176,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
