African Filmmaking is the first comprehensive study in English linking filmmaking in the Maghreb with that in the 12 independent states of francophone West Africa. Roy Armes examines a wide range of issues common to filmmakers throughout the region: the socio-political context, filmmaking in Africa before the mid-1960s, the involvement of African and French governments, questions of national and cultural identity, the issue of globalization, and, especially, the work of the filmmakers themselves over the past 40 years, with particular emphasis on younger filmmakers. Armes offers a wealth of information and a unique perspective on the history and future of African filmmaking.\n\nPublisher: Indiana University Press; First Edition edition (August 7, 2006)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0253218985\nISBN-13: 978-0253218988\n\nEditorial Reviews\nReview\n\n&quot;African Filmmaking is very much a film studies narrative... For classes that cover this terrain, it is supremely useful for students.
