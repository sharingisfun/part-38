Flynn's music is brimming over with heart, soul and intelligence. Drawing on diverse influences - The Pixies, Vaughn Williams and anti-folk pioneer Dianne Cluck are all name checked on his Myspace page - Johnny draws on a century's worth of Folk, Blues and Country to create a sound that dwells profoundly in the now. \n\nAcknowledging his debt to these musical traditions but never being overwhelmed by them, Johnny Flynn offers an alternative of substance to those who have grown sick of flimsy singer songwriters and their inane observations. A Larum was recorded deep in the Seattle countryside with producer Ryan Hadlock (The Strokes, Regina Spektor) at his secluded Bear Creek studio. Here they managed to capture the raw energy of Johnny Flynn's shows, underpinning the acoustic guitar, cello and ukulele with muscular drums and bass. \n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f400ca85439ba594cfd5a3a2ae84e13ca5744d45","amp;dn":"Johnny+Flynn...A+Larum%282008%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f400ca85439ba594cfd5a3a2ae84e13ca5744d45","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,0,202,133,67,155,165,148,207,213,163,162,174,132,225,60,165,116,77,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
