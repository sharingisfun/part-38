It was released in May 1986 by Capitol Records and was the last album that Clinton would record for the label. Recording sessions for the album utilized a small cadre of P-Funk musicians including Bootsy Collins, Garry Shider, and DeWayne &quot;Blackbyrd&quot; McKnight, as well as the debut recorded appearance of former Miss America Vanessa L. Williams on the opening track &quot;Hey Good Lookin'&quot;. R&amp;B Skeletons in the Closet was produced by Clinton, Steve Washington, Shider, and Andre Jackson.\n\nThe album's concept deals with black musical artists attempts to &quot;cross over&quot; to white audiences and losing their core black audience in the process. R&amp;B Skeletons in the Closet expands on the dance-funk sound of Clinton's previous solo albums, and it also incorporates elements of electro and hip hop music.[8] The album was reissued on CD by Capitol Records in 1991, but went out of print shortly thereafter.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85aa2e792df0cd3b9c55eeef0de7b620f484dc93","amp;dn":"George+Clinton+-+R%26amp%3B+B+Skeletons+in+the+Closet+320cbr+1986","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85aa2e792df0cd3b9c55eeef0de7b620f484dc93","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,170,46,121,45,240,205,59,156,85,238,239,13,231,182,32,244,132,220,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
