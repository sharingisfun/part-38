Duets features six original songs co-written by the Bluhms, plus two covers: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Running WildÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ by Ray Edenton and Donny Winters; and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Reno, NevadaÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ by Richard FariÃƒÂ±a. The couple recorded the songs at their San Francisco studio, Mission Bells, with producer Dan Prothero (TimÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s solo album California Way, Galactic, Papa Mali, JJ Grey &amp; Mofro).\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Duets sounds like a smile,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ says Nicki. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Duets is a collection of songs from the past and of the present. Its simplicity and authenticity captures an era forgotten while being fresh and new. These are songs filled with love, character and charm that you can hear on every track.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nThough Duets is a debut, this isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t the first time that music lovers have heard of Tim &amp; Nicki Bluhm as a performing duo. While most may know of Tim as the co-founder of The Mother Hips, currently celebrating 20 years as a quintessential California cult band, he also doubles as a Grambler -- as in Nicki Bluhm &amp; The Gramblers, that is. Duets arrives in the midst of a breakout year for Nicki, whose remarkable second solo release, Driftwood, was produced by Tim and includes tracks featuring lead vocals by the couple. On the live music circuit, fans throughout the western states have had their hearts captured by Tim &amp; Nicki, who have brought audiences to a hush at house concerts and rock clubs, gilded music theaters and vast folk music festivals. Their success is a testament to their special chemistry and to the singing and playing strengths of two individuals in a riveting duet experience.. .","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:00da79c5a0a5a67b63ee7e1dc92a2032ed19d7e3","amp;dn":"Nicki+Bluhm+%26amp%3B+Tim+Bluhm+-+Duets+%5B2011%5D%5BEAC%2CLOG%2CCUE%2CFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"00da79c5a0a5a67b63ee7e1dc92a2032ed19d7e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,218,121,197,160,165,166,123,99,238,126,29,201,42,32,50,237,25,215,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
