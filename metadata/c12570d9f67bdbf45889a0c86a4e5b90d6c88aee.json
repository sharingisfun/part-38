Most noted for being the last feature film of Michael Powell, also he is assisted by his trusty side-kick Emeric Pressburger. It's not a typical Powell film, but it's as much fun as his Tales of Hoffman or Sorcerer's Apprentice.\n\nROTTEN QUALITY, don't say I didn't warn you! This film seems to have been rescued from the garbage can, we're lucky it exists at all.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c12570d9f67bdbf45889a0c86a4e5b90d6c88aee","amp;dn":"The+Boy+who+Turned+Yellow+%281972%29+Powell+Pressburger","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c12570d9f67bdbf45889a0c86a4e5b90d6c88aee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,37,112,217,246,123,219,244,88,137,160,200,106,78,91,144,214,200,138,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
