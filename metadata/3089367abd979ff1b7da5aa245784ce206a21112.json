I think it is a bit overrated. The music itself is very good, but definitely not a masterpiece. Actually, I find the music unequal; the melodies are often not really convincing or just simply not sufficient enough to be completely impressed. The rhythm and airs constantly change: it makes a VERY progressive album. The music seriously lacks follow-through, so that it often sounds like a series of independant parts sequenced together. The instruments are well played, but I find very little emotion involved, despite the presence of many floating mellotron passages...\n...Regarding influences, King Crimson circa Wake of Poseidon is inevitable.&quot;\n\n(Review from Greenback at http://www.progarchives.com/album.asp?id=967)\n...IMO, nothing else to add!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3089367abd979ff1b7da5aa245784ce206a21112","amp;dn":"Museo+Rosenbach+-+1973+-+Zarathustra+%28Rock+Progressivo+Italiano%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3089367abd979ff1b7da5aa245784ce206a21112","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,137,54,122,189,151,159,241,183,218,90,162,69,120,76,226,6,162,17,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
