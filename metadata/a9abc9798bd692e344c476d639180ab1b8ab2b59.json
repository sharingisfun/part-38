From the death of Stalin, the Watergate scandal and Vietnam to the fall of the Berlin wall, the new era and the traumatic refutation of the dream of a better world at the turn of the century.\n\nAs though in a dream, A. recalls people and events in the past and painfully relives them in the present. In a deserted Berlin at the dawn of the 21st century, the snow falls silently on time past and time passing, on the universe.\n\n\nAdditional resources: \nGo to the tube and add /watch?v=lDaMx5umnVc (trailer)\nhttp://www.dustoftime.com (official site)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9abc9798bd692e344c476d639180ab1b8ab2b59","amp;dn":"Dust.of.Time.2008.DVDRip.XviD.gg666","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a9abc9798bd692e344c476d639180ab1b8ab2b59","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,171,201,121,139,214,146,227,68,196,118,214,57,24,10,177,184,171,43,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
