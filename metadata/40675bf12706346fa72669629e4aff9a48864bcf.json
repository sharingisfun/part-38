The book covers the famous cracking of the current bell Big Ben in 1859, with sketches of all the characters involved, the two world wars, and the disaster of 1976. The book ends with a detailed technical description of the clock mechanism.\n\nThe book is richly illustrated, and will appeal not only to clockmakers and horologists, but to bell enthusiasts, and those with an interest in our rich Victorian heritage.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:40675bf12706346fa72669629e4aff9a48864bcf","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B2010%5D+Big+Ben+The+Great+Clock+and+the+Bells+at+the+Palace","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"40675bf12706346fa72669629e4aff9a48864bcf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,103,91,241,39,6,52,111,167,38,105,98,158,74,255,154,72,134,75,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
