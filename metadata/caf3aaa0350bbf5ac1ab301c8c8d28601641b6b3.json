This never really materialized due to poor ticket sales, so that makes this recording all the more important to all of the disappointed ELO fans. The show kicks off in a grand fashion as the giant pod-like spaceship, that has enveloped the stage, begins to pulsate radiant blue and white light while individual branches of the pod all start to open and rise upward revealing the band and the fog shrouded stage below. The opening sound effects soon fade into the famous opening guitar riff to &quot;Do Ya&quot; being hammered out by a black suited Lynne, whose trademark dark sunglasses, giant semi-afro, and scruffy beard make him look more like a Muppet character than ever.\n\nSet List\nDo Ya\nEvil Woman\nShowdown\nStrange Magic\nLivin&amp;#039; Thing\nAlright\nLonesome Lullaby\nTelephone Line\nTurn To Stone\nJust For Love\nEasy Money\nMr. Blue Sky\nMa-Ma-Ma Belle\nOne Summer Dream\nTightrope\nState Of Mind\nCan&amp;#039;t Get It Out Of My Head\nMoment in Paradise\n10538 Overture\nOrdinary Dream\nShine A Little Love\nDon&amp;#039;t Bring Me Down\nRoll Over Beethoven","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:caf3aaa0350bbf5ac1ab301c8c8d28601641b6b3","amp;dn":"ELO+.-.+Zoom+tour+live","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"caf3aaa0350bbf5ac1ab301c8c8d28601641b6b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,243,170,160,53,11,191,90,193,171,48,28,140,141,40,96,22,65,182,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
