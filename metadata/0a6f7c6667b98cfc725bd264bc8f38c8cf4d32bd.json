Taylor always been such a huge fan of creative writing in horror, epic adventure, fantasy, and thrillers of all shapes and sizes. Since a small boy, he began writing short stories in elementary school. These stories were unusually dark and raised questions with his teachers resulting in several interviews with the schoolÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s principal.

I guess that I always was since the beginning. As I have said before, there is nothing that will stop me to write, nothing except being on the wrong side of a copper-jacketed hallow point!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n \nDouglas lives with his wife, Laura, and Sophie, their pet cat in Deadwood, South Dakota. Douglas is also the designer and writer of the Douginator Online Magazine.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a6f7c6667b98cfc725bd264bc8f38c8cf4d32bd","amp;dn":"Tales+From+Under+the+Concrete","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a6f7c6667b98cfc725bd264bc8f38c8cf4d32bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,111,124,102,103,185,140,252,114,91,210,100,188,143,56,200,207,77,50,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
