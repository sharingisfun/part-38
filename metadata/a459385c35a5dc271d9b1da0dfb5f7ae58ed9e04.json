And various of their songs should be admired as classics of pop history (&quot;It's All Leading Up to Saturday Night&quot;, &quot;Wait for Me Mary-Anne&quot;, &quot;Mr. Lion&quot;, &quot;Baby Make It Soon&quot;, &quot;Butterfly&quot;, &quot;Rainbow&quot;, &quot;The Ballad of Cherry Flavor&quot;, &quot;I'll Be Home (in a Day or So)&quot;, &quot;Kaleidoscope&quot;, &quot;Dear John&quot;, &quot;My Little One&quot;, &quot;Sarah&quot;, &quot;Lady of Catrine&quot;, &quot;Empty Bottles&quot;, &quot;She Wrote Me a Letter&quot;, &quot;Just One Woman&quot;). \n\nBut the only ones they seem to be really remembered for are their version of the Beatles' awful bubblegum schlager &quot;Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da&quot; (12/68), their own immortal &quot;Reflections of My Life&quot; (11/69) and maybe their mediocre, but catchy &quot;Cousin Norman&quot; (8/71) and &quot;Radancer&quot; (3/72) plus their very last hit &quot;Falling Apart at the Seams&quot; (2/76).\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a459385c35a5dc271d9b1da0dfb5f7ae58ed9e04","amp;dn":"Marmalade...Reflections+of+the+Marmalade%3B+The+Anthology%282001%292CD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a459385c35a5dc271d9b1da0dfb5f7ae58ed9e04","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,89,56,92,53,165,220,39,29,155,29,160,223,181,247,174,88,237,158,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
