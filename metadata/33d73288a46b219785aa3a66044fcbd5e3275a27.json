First archiver to do so.You do not need to worry about compatibility problems with PowerArchiver if you are using or considering upgrading to Windows 7 and Windows 8 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ we have done extensive testing to ensure everything works perfectly.

No problem for PowerArchiver Ã¢â‚¬â€œ we have exclusive support for VSS (volume shadow support), which is usually used only by enterprise backups to access data that is not accessible to other programs.\n\nMost Advaced ZIP/ZIPX Engine:\n===========================\nZIP Support PowerArchiver offers superior ZIP and ZIPX format support compared to other archivers.Here are the highlights:\n-Multicore deflate zip engine, almost 4x faster than single core systems on quad core computers. (3x faster than WinZip 15)\n-Improved speed of zip compression and extraction on any occasion.\n-Full support for advanced ZIPX format Ã¢â‚¬â€œ LZMA, JPEG, PPMd, BZIP2 and WAVPACK in ZIP/ZIPX, according to latest ZIP standards. PowerArchiver is the only application that fully supports Winzip 15 and earlier files, while providing faster (up to 3x) and stronger compression compared to WinZip 15.\n-Full support for more basic ZIP format that is compatible with all archivers out there, as well as the built-in Windows XP/Vista/7 zip reader.\n-Unlimited size of the archive, unlimited size of files inside archive and unlimited number of files inside archive.\n-Multicore LZMA engine for ZIP/ZIPX.\n-Support for Unicode in ZIP, both read and write.

It is an open source format, providing an open architecture and high compression ratio. 7-Zip outperforms ZIP, ACE and even RAR in many tests. However, 7-ZipÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s greatest strength is that it is not controlled by any organization or individual, but by an open source LGPL project to which anyone can contribute. More information on 7-Zip and its superior compression can be found at 7-Zip.org.\nPowerArchiver also features a Transparent Update feature for 7-Zip archives, which allows you to quickly add or remove files even if the archive is Ã¢â‚¬Å“SolidÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. PowerArchiver supports all 7zip methods, including LZMA2.\n\nSuperior RAR extraction:\n======================\nOur engineers have spent months of development time to custom tune extraction of RAR archives. End result is that we now have the fastest RAR extraction engine on the market, which extracts up to 10% faster than everyone else, including WinRar 4.x!\n\nMultiple Formats Support Including ISO:\n==================================\nPowerArchiver has native support for most popular compressed and encoded formats currently in use.

This is the first time such an option is available in compression utility, and it enables you to better organize your compression, extraction and backups, as well as schedule multiple jobs to be done sequentially without slowing down your system Ã¢â‚¬â€œ as multiple compressions would do if run all at once. Another first for PowerArchiver.\nPowerArchiver Starter is a brand new system tray application for managing your Queue and launching the most recently used archives and backups.
