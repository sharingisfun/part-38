With the trio of double bassist Pascal\nNiggenkemper, Simon Nabatov, and Gerald Cleaver, there are three such\ninstigators, and on Upcoming Hurricane, these the three musicians collaborate\nto create nearly a perfect storm.\n\nA relative newcomer, German-born Niggenkemper invited the two veterans for this\nimprovisation session, and as such, he is the architect of these\ntracks. Certainly, his bass stands up as an equal voice here, opening the disc\nwith swirling bow work on &quot;Pusteblume,&quot; with Nabatov's piano detonated first\nfrom the inside (strings), then with some contemplative wondering at the keys;\nthis coming together through mushrooming energy is an appealing feature\nthroughtout. Cleaver's scavenging work at his kit can take on &quot;found sounds,&quot;\nlike that of hubcaps and wind chimes, on &quot;Fighting The Mill&quot;; like his work in\nFarmers By Nature, with William Parker and Craig Taborn, Cleaver shifts from\nminimalist to thunderous fomenter with ease. But, then, so can Nabatov. The\npianist, whose previous work with the drummers such as Tom Rainey, Paul Lovens,\nand Michael Sarin, can approach these interactions with the scrabble of horn\nplayer and the painter-like qualities of a stringed instrument. The delicacy of\nhis playing balances Niggenkemper's fiery momentum and Cleaver's decorations.\n\nThe best example of this group's facility is on the nearly 12-minutes title\ntrack, where the trio builds a dense, layered, and ever-increasingly energized\nsound that morphs constantly into a thunderhead. The brewing tempest has\nNabatov favoring left hand rumblings, Niggenkemper the reverberations of energy\nfrom bowed and plucked strings, and Cleaver a churning surge of power. It is a\nmasterpiece of instant composition.\n\n--\n\nBy Martin Schray &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.freejazzblog.org/2012/07/pascal-niggenkemper-upcoming-hurricane.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.freejazzblog.org/2012/07/pascal-niggenkemper-upcoming-hurricane.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBy Stephan Moore\n\nDi Giuseppe Mavilla (it)\n\nPor Sergio Piccirilli (es) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://elintruso.com/2011/11/28/niggenkemper-nabatov-cleaver-upcoming-hurricane/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://elintruso.com/2011/11/28/niggenkemper-nabatov-cleaver-upcoming-hurricane/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f527493e9943171167e2df1cf47115927f0e5fa1","amp;dn":"Pascal+Niggenkemper+-+Upcoming+Hurricane+%282011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f527493e9943171167e2df1cf47115927f0e5fa1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,39,73,62,153,67,23,17,103,226,223,28,244,113,21,146,127,14,95,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
