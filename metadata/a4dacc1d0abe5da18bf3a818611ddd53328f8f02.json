Twelve episodes were made (two series, each of six episodes). The show was written by John Cleese and Connie Booth, who both also starred in the show; they were married at the time of series 1 but divorced before recording series 2.\r\n\r\nThe series is set in Fawlty Towers, a fictional hotel in the seaside town of Torquay, on the &quot;English Riviera&quot;. The plots centre on tense, rude and put-upon owner Basil Fawlty (Cleese), his bossy wife Sybil (Prunella Scales), comparatively normal chambermaid Polly (Booth), and hapless Spanish waiter Manuel (Andrew Sachs), showing their attempts to run the hotel amidst farcical situations and an array of demanding and eccentric guests.\r\n\r\nIn a list drawn up by the British Film Institute in 2000, voted by industry professionals, Fawlty Towers was named the best British television series of all time","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4dacc1d0abe5da18bf3a818611ddd53328f8f02","amp;dn":"Fawlty+Towers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4dacc1d0abe5da18bf3a818611ddd53328f8f02","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,218,204,29,10,190,93,161,139,243,168,24,97,29,221,83,50,143,143,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
