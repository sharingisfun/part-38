It starts as mid-level drug dealer, D'Angelo Barksdale, beats a murder rap. After a conversation with a judge, Det. James McNulty has been assigned to lead a joint homicide and narcotics team in order to bring down drug kingpin Avon Barksdale. Avon Barksdale, accompanied by his right-hand man Stringer Bell, enforcer Wee-Bey and many lieutenants (including his own nephew, D'Angelo Barksdale), has to deal with law enforcement, informants in his own camp, and competition with a local rival, Omar, who's been robbing Barksdale's dealers and reselling the drugs. The supervisor of the investigation, Lt. Cedric Daniels, has to deal with his own problems, such as a corrupt bureaucracy, some of his detectives beating suspects, hard-headed but determined Det. McNulty, and a blackmailing deputy. The show depicts the lives of every part of the drug &quot;food chain&quot;, from junkies to dealers, and from cops to politicians.\n \n\nRATING on tvrage 9.4/10\nGenre: \tAction | Crime | Drama\nStatus: \tCanceled/Ended\nNetwork: \tHBO ( USA)\nAirs: \tSundays at 09:00 pm\nRuntime: \t60 Minutes\nPremiere: \tJune 02, 2002\nEnded: \tMarch 09, 2008\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa9ea837c33c5d5a39cb8c51826fcef201baa908","amp;dn":"The.Wire.S01E01.320p.HDTV.H264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa9ea837c33c5d5a39cb8c51826fcef201baa908","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,158,168,55,195,60,93,90,57,203,140,81,130,111,206,242,1,186,169,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
