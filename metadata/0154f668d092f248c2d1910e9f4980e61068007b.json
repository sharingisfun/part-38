The Newcastle-based duo, who have just released their first EP, met while studying folk and traditional music at Newcastle University. Jonny won a prize for his song-writing while there, and most of the material they perform together is their own. They have supported The Unthanks on tour and look set for a bright future.\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0154f668d092f248c2d1910e9f4980e61068007b","amp;dn":"Jonny+Kearney+%26amp%3B+Lucy+Farrell...Kite%282011%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0154f668d092f248c2d1910e9f4980e61068007b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,84,246,104,208,146,242,72,194,209,145,14,159,73,128,230,16,104,0,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
