But as scientists break open the mindÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s black box with the latest tools of neuroscience, they re discovering that this is not how the mind works. Our best decisions are a finely tuned blend of both feeling and reason and the precise mix depends on the situation. When buying a house, for example, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best to let our unconscious mull over the many variables. But when weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re picking a stock, intuition often leads us astray. The trick is to determine when to use the different parts of the brain, and to do this, we need to think harder (and smarter) about how we think.\n\n    Explaining decision-making on the scale of neurons makes for a challenging task, but Lehrer handles it with confidence and grace. As an introduction to the cognitive struggle between the brainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“executiveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ rational centers and its more intuitive regions, Ã¢â‚¬Å“How We DecideÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ succeeds with great panache.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.jonahlehrer.com/books/how-we-decide/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.jonahlehrer.com/books/how-we-decide/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab178d045f4a9fb33f614d8f590e14bb74861693","amp;dn":"Jonah+Leher","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab178d045f4a9fb33f614d8f590e14bb74861693","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,23,141,4,95,74,159,179,63,97,77,143,89,14,20,187,116,134,22,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
