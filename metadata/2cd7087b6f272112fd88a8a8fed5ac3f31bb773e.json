When it comes to movies like this one, \nyou just can't have it all. We wanted to keep both \nDTS and DD5.1 on this one, but something had to pay \nfor that, this time menu on disc2 had to go. Keeping \nmenu on disc2 would leave us only 2880 bitrate, and \nwe know some people would freak out cause of that. \nGOOGLE did a &amp;quot;easy&amp;quot; solution by splitting 2 discs \nto 4 discs, we didnt think this was a good solution. \n\nIf menu on disc2 is that important for you, we \nsuggest you go buy this great movie! Our solution \non this rip is what we though would be best for \nmost of you out there, and we hope you will \nenjoy it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2cd7087b6f272112fd88a8a8fed5ac3f31bb773e","amp;dn":"The+Lord+Of+The+Rings+The+Return+Of+The+King+SEE+PAL+NORDIC+2DIS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2cd7087b6f272112fd88a8a8fed5ac3f31bb773e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,215,8,123,111,39,33,18,253,136,168,168,254,213,172,63,49,187,119,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
