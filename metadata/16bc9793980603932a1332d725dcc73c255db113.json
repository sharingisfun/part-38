Kowald plays his bass throughout, with\nhalf the tracks pizzi and half arco. Both giants of free improvisation had\nactually never played together, met shortly when Kowald was traveling in the\nUS, recorded this performance, and they actually never managed to even discuss\nwhat to do with the material, and then Kowald passed away. Luckily bassist JC\nJones from Kadima Records asked Golia whether he had any material with\nbassists, and that's the how this album came to be.\n\nAbout the music : fourteen relative short tracks, on which both musicians play\nwhat comes to mind, yet the ease with which they find a common language is\npossibly the most stunning part of this album. Some pieces are abstract, some\nmore melodic, some are abrasive, some tantric, some are intense, some hypnotic,\nothers are calm and subdued, yet despite all the variation and the differences\nin mood and musical exploration, just a few scene-setting notes from one\nmusician are sufficient to have the other enter the dialogue in the same\nlanguage. The breadth of their musical baggage and the incredible scope of\nsounds they can get out their instruments make this possible. Two examples. On\nthe sixth track Kowald's arco is accompanied by low monotonal tantric singing\non his part, with Golia's tarogato playing a very sad and melodious line over\nit, and gradually they build up the momentum, the volume and the power of the\npiece, slowing down to a state of peace. On the twelfth track, the longest one,\nKowald starts with repetitive arco phrasing, and Golia enters softly with\ncircular breathing on his A clarinet, and when the arco moves into the higher\nregions with piercing sounds, the clarinet goes up too, with screaching\nphrases, then going down again, then up again, like two birds in full flight\nchasing one another, interchanging positions about who follows who, and the\nimprovisation indeed has something of the flight of the bumble-bee in all its\nrapid progression. Every track has its own story, its own interaction. A rich\nalbum by two creative minds who know/knew what music is all about.\n\n--\n\nBy Nic Jones &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=33790&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=33790&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBy Wilbur MacKenzie &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=35756&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=35756&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:16bc9793980603932a1332d725dcc73c255db113","amp;dn":"Peter+Kowald+%26amp%3B+Vinny+Golia+-+Mythology+%282009%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"16bc9793980603932a1332d725dcc73c255db113","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,188,151,147,152,6,3,147,42,19,50,215,37,220,199,60,37,93,177,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
