The movies are complete DVD's and in an ISO format that will require a program like Daemon Tools  (a free program available on the Internet) to mount them on a virtual hard-drive so they will play automatically like any other DVD.  If interested, they may be burned onto a blank DVD disc after mounting.\n\nApocalypse - Caught in the Eye of the Storm:\nBronson Pearl and Helen Hannah are two news broadcasters who are covering the impending war in Israel. Yet, suddenly millions of people disappear, then a new leader performs an incredible miracle. These are astounding media events. Helen soon comes to the realization that these times are fulfilling biblical prophesy... and she was left behind.

In this movie Thorold Stone is still looking for his family. The Christians, whom the rest of the world has started to call The Haters, are being framed for many murders and terrorist acts. Thorold and his partner go to investigate the location of the detonator of one of these acts. They find a group of Christians holding a service. He arrests them and one of them hands him a disk from O.N.E. , One Nation Earth. He finds men in the building who aren't Christians. They chase them around and one of them is killed. Then he meets with Mr. Parker who works for Franco Malacousso. Parker shoots them both but Thorold doesn't die. He is then framed for the shooting of his partner and he goes to a computer programmer with the disk. Virtual Reality is used to bring the Day of Wonders to fruition. There is something odd about the cd that the woman gave Thorold because the programmer can't get access to it and they take it to the Christians headquarters. Further things develop and throughout the film there are repeated attempts to convert Thorold to Christianity. It isn't until he meets up with the Anti-Christ that he makes up his mind one way or the other. When they find out what the day of wonders is they try to destroy the program that will run it. Review written by Deirdre Dear\n\nThorold Stone's family was among those who vanished three months ago, and he is still stung by that fact. Since childhood, he has always been logical and suspicious, and, of course, he's uncertain whether Franco Macalousso is the Messiah he claims he is. Stone works for Len Parker, who runs One Nation Earth, the organization that rounds up the Haters who stand in Macalousso's way. Soon, however, he realises that the Christians have been framed, and he has been set up. To prove Macalusso's true colours, he must band with his own enemies - the Haters themselves, led by Helen Hannah. Review written by The Extra in the Background\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTribulation:\nTom Canboro is a police detective with a Christian sister, Eileen, a brother, Calvin, a wife, Susan, and eccentric brother-in-law, Jason. One night, Jason seemingly goes insane and tries to kill Eileen, calling her a &quot;hater&quot;. Tom soon realises this may be a conspiracy going as far as devil worship, but as he speeds in his car to get help, he suddenly loses control and crashes. Waking up in a strange hospital, he finds years have passed and people all over the world are wearing the mark of 666 on their right hands, and all those who don't are being killed off. Franco Macalusso, the believer in world peace Jason was fond of, now controls the world, and is trying to bring the world together as it was at the tower of Babel. Meanwhile, the &quot;Haters&quot; or Christians are hiding out and airing TBN tapes on the air for people to realise the Messiah is really the Antichrist, but their leader, Helen Hannah, is arrested...\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nApocalypse IV - Judgement:\nThe devil rules. God's followers are hunted and prosecuted. Their only defense is to put God on trial.  Helen Hannah, the Christian leader of &quot;Apocalypse&quot; &quot;Revelation&quot; and &quot;Tribulation&quot; is being put on trial in the One Nation Earth Court of Justice. Mitch Kendrick is a lawyer assigned to defend her, and Victoria Thorne, his ex-lover, is the attorney. Not only is the entire trial scripted, but Kendrick is on the fence about whose side he's on.
