Much of the work deals with ideas such as the &quot;eternal recurrence of the same&quot;, the parable on the &quot;death of God&quot;, and the &quot;prophecy&quot; of the Overman, which were first introduced in The Gay Science.\nDescribed by Nietzsche himself as &quot;the deepest ever written&quot;, the book is a dense and esoteric treatise on philosophy and morality, featuring as protagonist a fictionalized Zarathustra. A central irony of the text is that the style of the Bible is used by Nietzsche to present ideas of his which fundamentally oppose Judaeo-Christian morality and tradition.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce04f00e99eb14585bce51db80c8378796445101","amp;dn":"Thus+Spake+Zarathustra+by+Friedrich+Nietzsche+%5BrepublicV%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce04f00e99eb14585bce51db80c8378796445101","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,4,240,14,153,235,20,88,91,206,81,219,128,200,55,135,150,68,81,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
