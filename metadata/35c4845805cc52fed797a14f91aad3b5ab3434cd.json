Combining fresh treatments of classic problems with up-to-date research, asymptotic techniques appropriate for nonlinear dynamical systems are shown to offer a powerful alternative to numerical simulations. The combined analytical and experimental description of dynamical instabilities provides a clear derivation of physical formulae and an evaluation of their significance. Starting with the observation of different time scales of an operating laser, the book develops approximation techniques to systematically explore their effects. Laser dynamical regimes are introduced at different levels of complexity, from standard turn-on experiments to stiff, chaotic, spontaneous or driven pulsations. Particular attention is given to quantitative comparisons between experiments and theory. The book broadens the range of analytical tools available to laser physicists and provides applied mathematicians with problems of practical interest, making it invaluable for graduate students and researchers.\n\n\nAbout the Author\nTHOMAS ERNEUX is a Professor of Theoretical Nonlinear Optics at UniversitÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Libre de Bruxelles. His current interests concentrate on studying specific laser dynamical phenomena and the applications of delay differential equations in all areas of science and engineering.\n\nPIERRE GLORIEUX is a Professor in the Laboratoire de Physique des Lasers, Atomes et MolÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©cules, UniversitÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© des Sciences &amp; Technologies de Lille, and a senior member of the Institut Universitaire de France. Recently he has studied spatiotemporal dynamics in liquid crystals and photorefractive oscillators.\nProduct Details\n\n    * Hardcover: 376 pages\n    * Publisher: Cambridge University Press; 1 edition (June 7, 2010)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 0521830400","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:35c4845805cc52fed797a14f91aad3b5ab3434cd","amp;dn":"Laser+Dynamics%2C1st+Edition%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"35c4845805cc52fed797a14f91aad3b5ab3434cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,196,132,88,5,204,82,254,215,151,161,79,145,170,211,181,171,52,52,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
