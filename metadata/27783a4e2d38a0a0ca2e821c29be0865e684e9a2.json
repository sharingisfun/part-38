Gallimore&amp;#039;s amazing book Unified Field Theory Research Book - Using Subjective Response to PSI-Plasma for Analysis of Properties Neutral Charge Plasma Fields (1974) which begins with an investigation into certain subjective responses of people recorded by investigators to determine the reality of the effects. Gallimore next does an extensive comparative analysis of the properties of Od and Orgone. Chapters include: Baron Von Reichenbach: Properties of Odic Force, Wilhelm Reich: Properties of Orgone Energy, Other Investigators: Properties, Ordering of Properties, Commentary on Properties: Electrical &amp; Physics Parameters, Similarity to Hypothesis of Proposed Theorems, Physics of the &quot;lost&quot; Vector, Effects of Magnetism: The Od Force, Conclusion: Letters on Od &amp; Magnetism; O&amp;#039;Byrne, Odic Light in Modified External Conditions of the magnet. 125 pages, many pictures. A must read for everyone.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:27783a4e2d38a0a0ca2e821c29be0865e684e9a2","amp;dn":"Gallimore+-+Unified+Field+Theory+Research+Book+-+Using+Subjectiv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"27783a4e2d38a0a0ca2e821c29be0865e684e9a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,120,58,78,45,56,160,160,202,46,130,28,41,190,8,101,230,132,233,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
