They travel to the temple of Angkor Wat,\nCambodia in the hope of finding the mystical &quot;Iris.&quot; However, the trip is\ncut short by an accident where Lara is forced to abandon her companion in order\nto save her own life. Back in the year 2000 Egypt (this is the only game in the\nseries to keep the globehopping to a minimum, aside from the prequel level\nthe entire game takes place in one country), Lara Croft uncovers an ancient\ntomb where a fearsome Egyptian God Set was once imprisoned. She unwittingly\nunleashes him and finds herself in a deadly race against time to restore\nthe god to his resting place before an apocalypse befalls Earth.\nUnfortunately, Von Croy becomes Lara's new rival as he is possessed by Set\nhimself and he makes things considerably more difficult. Lara travels across\nEgypt to collect the pieces of Horus's armour in order to defeat Set.\nThey are found in Pharos, Temple of Isis, Temple of Poseidon and Cleopatra's\nPalaces. She combines them (with the Amulet of Horus) in the Temple of Horus\nto finally defeat her enemy. However before Horus can be summoned, Set arrives\nand destroys the armour, knocking the amulet into the water. Lara quickly\nrecovers it and exits the Temple sealing the entrance shut with the amulet.\nShe must leave it in place to keep Set imprisoned for eternity.\nAs she reaches the exit of the temple, injured and exhausted, she is\nconfronted by Von Croy. Fearful that he may still be possessed she is\nreluctant to hold onto his hands and so falls into the darkness\n\n================================================================================|\n\nFeatures:\n# Epic Storyline: Go back in time and discover Lara's roots as an adventurer.\n# All-new smooth single skin technology for both you and adult Lara Croft.\n# New inventory system: allowing Lara to combine items to make tools,\n  enhance weapons and solve puzzles during her adventuring!\n# Interactive environments: Lara can shoot switches, read inscriptions,\n  light torches, kick down doors, etc.\n# More new moves than ever before: including climbing and swing from ropes.\n# New weapons and tools: including the revolver, crossbow, binoculars,\n  flashlight and various types of ammo.\n# Highly evolved A.I.: enemies mimic, counter and dodge Lara's moves. \n\n================================================================================|\n\n\nMinimum Specifications:\n    * Pentium II 266MHz Processor or equivalent without hardware 3D acceleration\n    * Pentium II 233MHz Processor or equivalent with hardware 3D acceleration\n    * Windows 95/98/XP/VISTA compatible computer system with 16MB of RAM 32MB recommended\n    * DirectX 6.1 or higher (included)\n    * 4X CD-ROM\n    * 4MB Video Card\n    * 100% DirectX 6.1 or higher compliant sound card\n    * Keyboard and mouse \n\n\n\n================================================================================|\n\nInstall\nUnzip, mount TLRUK.daa to virtual drive or burn to disk\nCopy fmv and data folder from image to installation folder\nRun trupdate.exe\n\nPlay","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f383ac08cbb268bc7f5f1714b4cd7708c33f4c68","amp;dn":"Tomb+Raider+The+Last+Revelation","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f383ac08cbb268bc7f5f1714b4cd7708c33f4c68","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,131,172,8,203,178,104,188,127,95,23,20,180,205,119,8,195,63,76,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
