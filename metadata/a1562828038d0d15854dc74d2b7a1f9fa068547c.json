A sensation on its publication in 1859, The Origin of the Species profoundly shocked Victorian readers by calling into question the belief in a Creator with its description of evolution through natural selection.  And DarwinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s seminal work is nearly as controversial today.  In her illuminating study, Browne delves into the long genesis of DarwinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s theories, from his readings as a university student and his five-year voyage on the Beagle, to his debates with contemporaries and experiments in his garden.  She explores the shock to Darwin when he read of competing scientistÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s similar discoveries and the wide and immediate impact of DarwinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s theories on the world. As one of the launch titles in Atlantic Monthly PressÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Books That Changed the WorldÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ series, BrowneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s history takes readers inside The Origin of the Species and shows why it can fairly claim to be the greatest science book ever published.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a1562828038d0d15854dc74d2b7a1f9fa068547c","amp;dn":"Janet+Browne+-+Darwin%27s+Origin+of+Species+%5Bepub%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a1562828038d0d15854dc74d2b7a1f9fa068547c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,86,40,40,3,141,13,21,133,77,199,77,43,122,31,159,160,104,84,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
