Two more Tudor Queens are yet to be portrayed and the Tudor children are all in their formative years. What will happen in the upcoming season? What faction at court will win the King's ear and how will they do it? Will Henry voice any regrets on his deathbed?\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1827d9cbfde4a9294824dd283b310a3085760cd","amp;dn":"The+Tudors++%28Season+4+-+Complete%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1827d9cbfde4a9294824dd283b310a3085760cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,130,125,156,191,222,74,146,148,130,77,210,131,179,16,163,8,87,96,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
