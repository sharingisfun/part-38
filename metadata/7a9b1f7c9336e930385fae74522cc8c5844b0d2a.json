TAhese features and more are available in the paid version called Malwarebytes Anti Malware Premium.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe main advantage of the free application is that it can be run as a secondary line of defense against online threats, by pairing it with the Real-Time Safeguard of another AV Utility's.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHassie-free installation and highly inuitive GUI\r\n\r\nSetting up Malwarebytes Anti-Malware shouldn't be a problem to any users, no matter how inexperienced they may be with Anti-Virus applications. As for the interface, the tool is an intuitive as they get, thanks to large buttons and short descriptions that explain each option.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo scans modes for basic PC protection\r\n\r\nThreat Scan is the app's comprehensive scanning method, as it looks into critical areas of the system where malware is known to hide. The alternative is Custom Scan, which permits users to hand pick the exact drives and directories to look into, along with the scan objects (memory, startup and registry setting, archives, rootkits). In addition, it is possible to personalize the tools behavior whern detecting potentially unwanted programs and modifications (PUM's).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdvanced scanner configuration\r\n\r\nUsers who want to further customize Anti-Malware's behavioral pattern may tinker with settings Surrounding Exclusions, Rootkits, Archives and Advanced Heuristics. It is possible to enable and examine scan logs, resort to a proxy server for virus database updates, disable notifications, integrate the app into Windows Explorer context menu for quick scanning and so on. Items sent to the quarantine can be examined before deciding whether to keep or delete them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPerformance and conclusion\r\n\r\nMy most recent test have shown that Malwarebytes Anti-Malware delivers very good results when it comes to virus detection. It's main downside, however, is that it frequently hangs during various operations (such as scanning or verifying the latest virus signatures) and it is generally very slow when it comes to removing the infected files.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo conclude, there are two sides to Malwarebytes Anti-Malware's story: hardcore PCV users who often travel to the dark side of the internet are better off with faster and more stable utilities. However, by pairing it up with a reliable Thirt-Party Real-Time Guard, the program can become quite handy to casual users who want to double-check.\r\n\r\n\r\nA complete history of product changes, updates, and fixes can be found here: \nhttps://www.malwarebytes.org/support/releasehistory/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWARNING: Malwarebytes and Norton Internet Security is flagging it as malware, but restore it and exclude it from the programs, and it works!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a9b1f7c9336e930385fae74522cc8c5844b0d2a","amp;dn":"Malwarebytes+Anti-Malware+Premium+2.2.0.1024+%2B+Serial+License","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a9b1f7c9336e930385fae74522cc8c5844b0d2a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,155,31,124,147,54,233,48,56,95,174,116,82,44,200,197,132,75,13,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
