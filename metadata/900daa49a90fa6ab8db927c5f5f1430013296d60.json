Deluxe anniversary products featured never-before-released bonus material and demos. As far as products, there is something for everyone from the hardcore, super fan to the teen who is just discovering SoundgardenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s music. In 2003, Rolling Stone ranked the album as one of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time and the 100 Greatest Albums of the Nineties.\n\n\n Soundgarden's finest hour, Superunknown is a sprawling, 70-minute magnum opus that pushes beyond any previous boundaries. Soundgarden had always loved replicating Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath riffs, but Superunknown's debt is more to mid-period Zep's layered arrangements and sweeping epics. Their earlier punk influences are rarely detectable, replaced by surprisingly effective appropriations of pop and psychedelia. Badmotorfinger boasted more than its fair share of indelible riffs, but here the main hooks reside mostly in Chris Cornell's vocals; accordingly, he's mixed right up front, floating over the band instead of cutting through it. The rest of the production is just as crisp, with the band achieving a huge, robust sound that makes even the heaviest songs sound deceptively bright. But the most important reason Superunknown is such a rich listen is twofold: the band's embrace of psychedelia, and their rapidly progressing mastery of songcraft. Soundgarden had always been a little mind-bending, but the full-on experiments with psychedelia give them a much wider sonic palette, paving the way for less metallic sounds and instruments, more detailed arrangements, and a bridge into pop (which made the eerie ballad &quot;Black Hole Sun&quot; an inescapable hit). That blossoming melodic skill is apparent on most of the record, not just the poppier songs and Cornell-penned hits; though a couple of drummer Matt Cameron's contributions are pretty undistinguished, they're easy to overlook, given the overall consistency. The focused songwriting allows the band to stretch material out for grander effect, without sinking into the pointlessly drawn-out muck that cluttered their early records. The dissonance and odd time signatures are still in force, though not as jarring or immediately obvious, which means that the album reveals more subtleties with each listen. It's obvious that Superunknown was consciously styled as a masterwork, and it fulfills every ambition.  \n\n\n\nDisc 1: Remastered album (including international album bonus track Ã¢â‚¬Å“She Likes SurprisesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½)\n\nCD1 #01 - Let Me Drown\n CD1 #02 - My Wave\n CD1 #03 - Fell On Black Days\n CD1 #04 - Mailman\n CD1 #05 - Superunknown\n CD1 #06 - Head Down\n CD1 #07 - Black Hole Sun\n CD1 #08 - Spoonman\n CD1 #09 - Limo Wreck\n CD1 #10 - The Day I Tried To Live\n CD1 #11 - Kickstand\n CD1 #12 - Fresh Tendrils\n CD1 #13 - 4th Of July\n CD1 #14 - Half\n CD1 #15 - Like Suicide\n CD1 #16 - She Likes Surprises\n\nDisc 2: B-sides and Unreleased Alternative Mixes\n\n CD2 #17 - The Day I Tried To Live (Alternate Mix)\n CD2 #18 - Spoonman (Alternate Steve Fisk Remix)\n CD2 #19 - Beyond The Wheel Live At Exibition Stadium, Toronto 1993)\n CD2 #20 - Fell On Black Days (Live At Pine Knob Music Theater, Clarkston, MI 1993)\n CD2 #21 - Birth Ritual (Original Demo Version)\n CD2 #22 - Jesus Christ Pose (Live At Rushmore Plaza Civic Center, Rapid City, SD 1993)\n CD2 #23 - Like Suicide (Acoustic Version)\n CD2 #24 - Kickstand (Live At Jones Beach Amphitheatre, Wantagh, NY 1993)\n CD2 #25 - My Wave (Live At Jones Beach Amphitheatre, Wantagh, NY 1993)\n CD2 #26 - Spoonman (Steve Fisk Remix)\n CD2 #27 - Exit Stonehenge\n CD2 #28 - Kyle Petty, Son Of Richard\n CD2 #29 - Black Days III\n CD2 #30 - Ghostmotorfinger\n CD2 #31 - Jerry Garcia's Finger\n CD2 #32 - Fell On Black Days (Video Version)\n\nUnreleased Demos\n\n CD3 #33 - Let Me Drown (Demo Version)\n CD3 #34 - Fell On Black Days (Demo Version)\n CD3 #35 - Superunknown (Demo Version)\n CD3 #36 - Black Hole Sun (Demo Version)\n CD3 #37 - Spoonman (Demo Version)\n CD3 #38 - Fresh Tendrils (Demo Version)\n CD3 #39 - 4th Of July (Demo Version)\n CD3 #40 - Half (Demo Version)\n CD3 #41 - Like Suicide (Demo Version)\n\nUnreleased Rehearsals from June Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ93\n\n CD4 #42 - Black Hole Sun (Rehearsal Version)\n CD4 #43 - Bing Bing Goes To Church (Rehearsal Version)\n CD4 #44 - Half (Instrumentally) (Rehearsal Version)\n CD4 #45 - Head Down (Rehearsal Version)\n CD4 #46 - Kyle Petty, Son Of Richard (Rehearsal Version)\n CD4 #47 - Let Me Drown (Rehearsal Version)\n CD4 #48 - Limo Wreck (Rehearsal Version)\n CD4 #49 - My Wave (Rehearsal Version)\n CD4 #50 - Fresh Tendrils (Rehearsal Version)\n CD4 #51 - Like Suicide (Rehearsal Version)\n CD4 #52 - Ruff Riff-Raff (Rehearsal Version)\n CD4 #53 - Spoonman (Rehearsal Version)\n CD4 #54 - The Date I Tried To Leave (Rehearsal Version)\n CD4 #55 - The Day I Tried To Live (Rehearsal Version)\n\n\nPlease Note: Track 17 is 192/24, tracks 18-31 are 44/16,\n track 32 is 192/24, tracks 33-41 are 96/24, and tracks 42-55 are 44/16.\n\n Thanks to the Original customer!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:900daa49a90fa6ab8db927c5f5f1430013296d60","amp;dn":"Soundgarden+-+Superunknown+%281994%29+%5BSuper+Deluxe+Edition+2014%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"900daa49a90fa6ab8db927c5f5f1430013296d60","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,13,170,73,169,15,166,171,141,185,39,197,245,241,67,0,19,41,109,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
