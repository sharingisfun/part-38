Since we've all started to use mp3 players, why should we be limited to albums of 74 to 80 minutes, right?\n\nI used 0SEx (http://www.macupdate.com/info.php/id/9830) to rip the AC3 files from the DVD.\n\nThen I used mAC3dec (http://sourceforge.net/projects/mac3dec) to convert the AC3's to MP3.\n\nMethod was based on the following guide:\nhttp://hotpot.me.uk/hp/misc/DVD-to-MP3.html\n\n\nAlso, check out my Nine Inch Nails photos, that I took during the Lowlands festival in 2007:\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/andra_veraart/tags/nineinchnails/\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:63953567f1176eaa263af2c8484262a2ce7e439b","amp;dn":"Nine+Inch+Nails+-+And+all+that+could+have+been+%28+DVD+to+MP3+%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"63953567f1176eaa263af2c8484262a2ce7e439b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,149,53,103,241,23,110,170,38,58,242,200,72,66,98,162,206,126,67,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
