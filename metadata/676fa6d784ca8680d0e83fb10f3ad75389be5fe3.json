LaGuardia High School in 1997, being a violin player for 14 years, and signed a production deal with the then-under-the-radar production team The Neptunes. They produced her debut album &quot;Kaleidoscope&quot; (1999), released on Virgin. Her sophomore release, &quot;Wanderland&quot; (2001), wasn't as fortunate and did not get released in the US, which led to tensions with Virgin; Kelis was later dropped because of lackluster performance. She found solace in a romance with rapper Nasir Jones whom she married to in 2005 and divorced from in 2010.\r\n\r\n[b]Kelis â€Žâ€“ Kaleidoscope\r\nGenre:[/b] Hip Hop, Pop\r\n[b]Style:[/b] RnB/Swing\r\n[b]Year:[/b] 1999\r\n \nhttp://i.imgur.com/m2aIEij.png%3Cimg%20class=\r\n\r\nExact Audio Copy V1.1 from 23.
