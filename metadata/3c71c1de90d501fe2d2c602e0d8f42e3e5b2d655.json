The Oasis sound signified a return to grass-roots rock'n'roll sensibilities with a strong sixties influence. The Gallagher brothers forged anthems filled with a sense of nostalgia and laddish pride, taking the music press by storm with a headline-grabbing swagger.\n\nEvery song from the album is transcribed here in accurate Guitar Tab, including the huge hits Live Forever, Supersonic and Cigarettes And Alcohol. \n\nTracklisting!\n\n\n1  -  Rock 'N' Roll Star \t5:22\n\n2  -  Shakermaker \t5:10\n\n3  -  Live Forever \t4:35\n\n4  -  Up In The Sky \t4:29\n\n5  -  Columbia \t6:08\n\n6  -  Sad Song \t4:30\n7  -  Supersonic \t4:42\n\n8  -  Bring It On Down \t4:18\n\n9  -  Cigarettes &amp; Alcohol \t4:50\n\n10 - Digsy's Dinner \t2:32\n\n11 - Slide Away \t6:31\n\n12 - Married With Children \t3:09","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c71c1de90d501fe2d2c602e0d8f42e3e5b2d655","amp;dn":"Oasis+-+Definitely+Maybe+%28Guitar+tab%29+PDF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c71c1de90d501fe2d2c602e0d8f42e3e5b2d655","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,113,193,222,144,213,1,254,45,44,96,46,13,143,66,227,229,178,214,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
