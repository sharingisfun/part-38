This two-LP set finds guitarist Al di Meola performing with his quintet of the time (featuring keyboardist Philippe Saisse), with studio musicians, solo, in a reunion with pianist Chick Corea, singing a love song, and welcoming veteran Les Paul for a version of &quot;Spanish Eyes.&quot; Most of the music works quite well and it shows that di Meola (best-known for his speedy rock-oriented solos) is a surprisingly well-rounded and versatile musician. \n\nCredits \n\nBacking Vocals Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Philippe Saisse (tracks: C3) \nBass Guitar Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Anthony Jackson (tracks: A2, B1, B3, D1), Tim Landers (tracks: A1, B3, C1) \nCello Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Dennis Karmzyn* (tracks: D2), Raymond J.
