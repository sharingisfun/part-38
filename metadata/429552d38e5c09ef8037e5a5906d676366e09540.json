Calling upon various surf and psychobilly acts like los Straitjackets, Reverend Horton Heat, and Rocket From the Crypt, Zombie has obviously invested great enthusiasm into this project, as have all the participants -- and it's even suitable for children! Highlights include Zacherele with Southern Culture on the Skids performing the (John Fogerty!) cover &quot;Sinister Purpose,&quot; and Deadbolt's &quot;Psychic Voodoo Doll.&quot; Great fun.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:429552d38e5c09ef8037e5a5906d676366e09540","amp;dn":"Halloween+Hootenanny+%5Bcron.d%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"429552d38e5c09ef8037e5a5906d676366e09540","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,149,82,211,142,92,9,239,128,55,229,165,144,109,103,99,102,224,149,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
