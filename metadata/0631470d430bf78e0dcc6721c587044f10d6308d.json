Wang et al. (CRC, 2006).pdf\r\n\r\nMany standard industrial waste treatment texts sufficiently address a few major technologies for conventional in-plant environmental control strategies in the food industry. But none explore the complete range of technologies with a focus on new developments in innovative and alternative technology, design criteria, effluent standards, managerial decision methodology, and regional and global environmental conservation specific to the food industry. Until now. Waste Treatment in the Food Processing Industry provides in-depth coverage of environmental pollution sources, waste characteristics, control technologies, management strategies, facility innovations, process alternatives, costs, case histories, effluent standards, and future trends. It delineates methodologies, technologies, and the regional and global effects of important pollution control practices. \r\n\r\nThe book highlights major food processing plants or installations that have significant effects on the environment. Since the areas of food industry waste treatment are broad, no one can claim to be an expert in all of them. Reflecting this, the editors recruited collective contributions from specialists in their respective topics, rather than relying on a single author's expertise. The topics covered include dairies, seafood processing plants, olive oil manufacturing factories, potato processing plants, soft drink production plants, bakeries, and various other food processing facilities. \r\n\r\nProfessors, students, and researchers in the environmental, civil, chemical, sanitary, mechanical, and public health engineering and science fields will find valuable educational materials in this book. The extensive bibliographies for each type of food waste treatment or practice will be invaluable to environmental managers, or researchers who need to trace, follow, duplicate, or improve on a specific food waste treatment practice. Comprehensive in scope, the book provides solutions that are directly applicable to the daily waste management problems specific to the food processing industry","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0631470d430bf78e0dcc6721c587044f10d6308d","amp;dn":"Waste+Treatment+in+the+Food+Processing+Industry","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0631470d430bf78e0dcc6721c587044f10d6308d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,49,71,13,67,11,247,142,13,204,103,33,197,135,4,79,16,214,48,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
