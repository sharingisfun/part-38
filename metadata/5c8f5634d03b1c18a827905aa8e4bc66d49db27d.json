Its mission: to clean up space; to remove from EarthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s orbit over a centuryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s worth of man-made junkÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nFrom the viewing window of a nearby space station, the Doctor and Flip have a unique view of Salvage 2 as it sets about its essential task Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and of the disaster that unfolds when Salvage 2 encounters something itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not been programmed to deal with. Something not of human manufactureÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nBack on Earth, the Doctor fights to save Flip from becoming part of a 500-year tragedy being played out in orbit, hundreds of miles above. And millions will die if he fails.\n\nWritten By: William Gallagher\nDirected By: Nicholas Briggs\n\nCast\n\nColin Baker (The Doctor), Lisa Greenwood (Flip Jackson), Anjli Mohindra (Jyoti Cutler), Tariq Bhatti (Salim), Kate McEwen (Jessica Allaway), Tania Rodrigues (Anarkali/Melissa/Isra Tech #2), John Banks (Commander Gabbard/Scavenger/Isra Tech #1/Security Guy)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c8f5634d03b1c18a827905aa8e4bc66d49db27d","amp;dn":"BF+184.+Scavenger+M4B+252kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c8f5634d03b1c18a827905aa8e4bc66d49db27d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,143,86,52,208,59,28,24,168,39,144,90,168,228,188,102,212,157,178,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
