I&amp;#039;ve left the directory structure more or less untouched, apart from moving the oneshots into categorized folders after trimming them appropriately.\n\nTorrent contains 3 RAR files with 515 samples\n---------------------------------------------\nHBA1 Bonus Drumloops (26)\nHBA1 Cons Kit Loops (283 loops in 32 kits)\nHBA1 Oneshots (206 drum and perc hits, basses and synths)\n\nFiles have beeen renamed to prevent confusion (how many samples called bass1.wav have you got already?) and many have also been converted to mono where right and left channels were identical.\nEach construction kit folder includes tempo and root key information, and all files are acidized.\nSamples are normalized 16-bit WAVs at 44.1KHz.\n\nDisc 2 will follow once I&amp;#039;ve restructured it in similar fashion.\n\n--\nArty - &quot;I need a break&quot;\n26th February 2008.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:49191fff53548251714ba445efda5565bb6e0663","amp;dn":"ArtyTorrent+Pack+88-BFA-Hardcore+Breakbeat+Action+1-WAV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"49191fff53548251714ba445efda5565bb6e0663","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,25,31,255,83,84,130,81,113,75,164,69,239,218,85,101,187,110,6,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
