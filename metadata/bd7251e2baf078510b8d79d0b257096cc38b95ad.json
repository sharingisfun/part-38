In the Octagon\n a submission specialist sees an opening and seizes it. He sets a trap\n and then springs it. He imposes his will and breaks his opponent's. \n If his opponent's will does not break, his bones will. This action-packed \n collection brings you all the best submissions from superstars \n Georges St-Pierre, Anderson Silva, BJ Penn, Frank Mir and others\n who found victory by pushing the ultimate limits of pain.\n\n Extras include Bonus Fights, Bonus from the Vault, and Just Won't Tap. \n\n Sometimes the AR goes from 16:9 to 4:3 and back.\n\n 50 Sick Submissions Enjoy! :-)\n\n                   \n                                          \n                                           \n                                                 \n\n   Our group is here to give you the best, the worst, the past and the present\n\n   from the world of combat sports, ranging from the mainstream fighting to the\n\n   not so mainstream fighting.
