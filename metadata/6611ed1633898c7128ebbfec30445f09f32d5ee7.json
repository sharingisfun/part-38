It enables customers to operate backup copies, watch AVCHD videos and manage there files. Formerly referred to as AVCHD and Game Manager, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s now being known as multiMAN. The term multi is important for this manager because of itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s multi purpose tools. multiMAN does more then just backup games for your PS3.\nA lot of changes and additions to the last 04.53.03 so I decided it is better to have it with different version.\nmultiMAN 04.53.04\n* Names of local PS3 games in ISO format are properly displayed (from PARAM.SFO)\n* Names of network and NTFS PS3 games in ISO format are properly displayed (from PARAM.SFO) after you load them at least once\n* PS3 ISO games from NTFS drives will now show background and cover (if loaded at least once)\n* Added support for checking for game updates for network and NTFS PS3 games in ISO format\n* Last loaded game/video (no network/ntfs) will be passed to webMAN for auto-load at next system start (making lastGAME almost obsolete)\n* While scanning for content, mmCM will prepare data for webMAN, too (NTFS info, images and param.sfo)\n* Upon launch, mM/mmCM will rescan your games and will cache images and other files\n* Small change to make mM Ã¢â‚¬Å“title_idÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ independent (in case you change it from the default BLES80608)\n* Downloading mM/mmCM updates is now Ã¢â‚¬Å“titleÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½/Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½nameÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ independent\n* In mmCM mode in HOME column you now have Ã¢â‚¬Å“Scan connected NTFS USB drivesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ option. In case you didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t connect the drive before launching mmCM you can use this option to refresh content from NTFS drives.\n\nPlease Seed ......","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6611ed1633898c7128ebbfec30445f09f32d5ee7","amp;dn":"multiMAN+ver+04.53.04+BASE+CEX+A+Newer+Version+For+PS3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6611ed1633898c7128ebbfec30445f09f32d5ee7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,17,237,22,51,137,140,113,40,235,191,236,48,68,95,9,243,45,94,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
