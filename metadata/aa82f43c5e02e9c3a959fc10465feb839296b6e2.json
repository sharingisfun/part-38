The album, their strongest to date, features twelve original tracks and one traditional bluegrass song (a nod to the deceased King of Bluegrass, Jimmy Martin) ,and showcases the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s songwriting and playing talents in a way that is incredibly accessible to fans of many different types of music. Carbone notes on the package: &quot;Five Interstates came together like five lives intertwined, the intersection of a lifetime frozen in precious time and preserved in a digital tableau. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m blessedÃ¢â‚¬Â¦WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re all blessed to be witness to a band ascending as true as an arrow shot to the sky.&quot;\nSince winning the 2006 Telluride Bluegrass Festival Band Contest, Greensky has been touring constantly, playing over 170 shows a year, and all the hard work is certainly paying off. Recent highlights are too many to list, but include selling out venues in many parts of the country, sharing the stage with musical heroes, getting asked to play shows with the likes of Tony Rice and Peter Rowan, Sam Bush, Yonder Mountain String Band and Railroad Earth, and being asked to play the inaugural Rothbury Festival in their home state of Michigan. &quot;It certainly felt like an affirmation that we are doing something right&quot;, noted bass player Mike Devol.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa82f43c5e02e9c3a959fc10465feb839296b6e2","amp;dn":"Greensky+Bluegrass+-+Five+Interstates+%5B2008%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa82f43c5e02e9c3a959fc10465feb839296b6e2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,130,244,60,94,2,233,195,169,89,252,16,70,95,235,131,146,150,182,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
