This is for two reasons:\n1) Technical issues which cause a new DVD must be used every single\n   episode. This is too expensive in the long run.\n2) A lack of willingness of most downloaders to seed up to a normal\n   ratio.\n\nThe obvious and already mentioned consequence is that that there will\nbe no more new releases of BBC HARDtalk, not by &quot;HardTalk&quot; anyway.\nA less obvious consequence is that all currently seeded torrents of\nBBC HARDtalk will be taken offline today and many of them will proba-\nbly die immediately or pretty soon.\n\nPeople who want to listen to Podcasts of HARDtalk, you can download\nthem here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/series/ht/all&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/series/ht/all&lt;/a&gt;\n\nYou can view HARDtalk on iPlayer from outside the UK by installing the\nHola Unblocker plugin from http://hola.org.
