The following tests are available:\n\n       *  Hardware Configuration\n       *  Device Drivers\n       *  Environment\n       *  Memory Map\n       *  IRQ/DMA\n       *  BIOS Configuration\n       *  Disk Configuration\n       *  PCI Configuration\n\n\nUsage:\n\nQAInfo can be used in three ways:\n\n       *  Interactively\n       *  Command-line options\n       *  Redirecting output\n\n\nInteractive:\n\nTo use QAInfo Interactively, type:  QAINFO.   This runs QAINFO in a menu\ndriven environment.\n\n\nComand-line Options:\n\nThere are two command line options available:\n\n       *  -f\n       *  -t\n\nThe -f option sends the data produced by QAINFO to a selected data file.\nThe -t option selects a test number.  The valid test numbers are:\n\n       *  201  Memory Map\n       *  202  Environment\n       *  203  Device Drivers\n       *  204  IRQ/DMA\n       *  205  Hardware Configuration\n       *  206  BIOS Configuration\n       *  207  DISK Configuration\n       *  209  PCI Configuration\n\nYou may use the command-line options as the following line illustrates:\n\n       QAINFO -t205 -fhardware.dat\n\nThis example selects test number 205, and the data is sent to a data\nfile by the name of hardware.dat.\n\n\nRedirecting Output:\n\nRunning QAINFO as follows sends the output data to standard out:\n\n       QAINFO -t205\n\n\nQAINFO.INI:\n\nThe first time QAINFO is run, it generates a QAINFO.INI file.  This\nconfiguration file allows you to select/deselect a test within the 204\nand 205 test suites.  The tests listed in this file are defaulted to\n'Y'es, however these tests can be turned off by setting the test to\n'N'o.\n\nSpecial note on hard and floppy disk checking:  to check the hard and\nfloppy disks, the Logical Drives switch must be set to =y.  The settings\nfor BIOS HDDs and BIOS FDDs key off of the Logical Drives setting.  For\nexample the following settings display both floppy and hard disk\nconfigurations even though both FDD and HDD are set to =n:\n\n       Logical Drives=y\n       BIOS HDDs=n\n       BIOS FDDs=n\n\n\nError Codes:\n\nQAINFO produces the following error numbers:\n\n*  0 = success\n*  -1 = invalid option(s)\n*  -2 = invalid file name selected\n*  -3 = invalid test number\n\n\nData File Options:\n\nQAINFO generates a data file for each test it runs.  This data file is\ndeleted by default in the interactive mode.  To over-ride this default\naction, you may select saving the data file option.  The files are saved\nwith the following file names:\n\n       test 205 - hardware.dat\n       test 202 - devdvr.dat\n       test 203 - environ.dat\n       test 201 - memmap.dat\n       test 204 - irqdma.dat\n       test 206 - bios.dat\n       test 207 - disk.dat\n       test 209 - pcicfg.dat\n\n\nRuntime Problems:\n\nQAINFO takes control of your computer's hardware to do it's testing.\nSome memory resident programs (TSR), device drivers, or newer\nhardware, may interfere with QAINFO's operation causing the system\nto lockup during program initialization or execution.\n\nIf you are experiencing problems, reboot your computer with no\nCONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT file.  With DOS version 6.0 and higher,\npressing the F5 key during boot-up will bypass the processing of the\nCONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files.  Re-run QAINFO in this mode to\ncheck your system again.\n\nIf the lockup problem still persists, you may edit the QAINFO.INI\nfile and turn off various tests until a suspect test can be isolated.\nEach Hardware, IRQ and DMA item that can be identified and tested is\nlisted in respective sections of the QAINFO.INI file. By default, each\nof these options is enabled, by the 'y' appearing after the specific\nitem.\n\nTo disable testing of one or more items, change the 'y' to 'n', save\nthe QAINFO.INI file and rerun QAINFO.EXE.  This process may take\nseveral iterations and some intuition before isolating the item of\nconcern.\n\n*** End of QAINFO.HLP ***\n\n\u001a","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c7ba759dcf1274048048cc730b78c5e5b56c227","amp;dn":"IRQ%2C+DMA%2C+and+I%2FO+Resolving+and+Preventing+PC+System+Conflicts.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c7ba759dcf1274048048cc730b78c5e5b56c227","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,123,167,89,220,241,39,64,72,4,140,199,48,183,140,94,91,86,194,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
