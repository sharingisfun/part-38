I don&amp;#039;t have images to include in this, and I apologize for that. I haven&amp;#039;t been posting stuff lately because I don&amp;#039;t have the time to make the pictures and upload them, and I do want to adhere to the torrent standards, but these are basically 2 collections of pin-up, covers, and posters. The first is all Marvel-related, and includes artists like Jae Lee, Alex Ross, ans Simon Bisley, among others.  The second is just Jim Lee.  Enjoy, Seed, yada yada!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4645d362e07362010a5ecc605e505907cb61c1d7","amp;dn":"Art+of+Marvel+Comics+and+Spotlight+on+Jim+Lee+%28Catseye2001%29+%5Bh33","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4645d362e07362010a5ecc605e505907cb61c1d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,69,211,98,224,115,98,1,10,94,204,96,94,80,89,7,203,97,193,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
