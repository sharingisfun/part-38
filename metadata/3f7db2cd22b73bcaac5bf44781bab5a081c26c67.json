He resuscitated the name a few years later as a music student at Ithaca College, incorporating dubstep, U.K. bass, and RnB elements into his atmospheric sounds, drawing comparisons to Grouper as well as house artists such as Salem and White Ring. Koone's debut album, Wander/Wonder, arrived in September 2011.\n\nReleased: Aug 30, 2011\nGenre: Electronic\nStyle: Dream\nQuality: Lossless\nCodec: FLAC\n\nTracks:\n\n 1. Welcome\n 2. Apart\n 3.
