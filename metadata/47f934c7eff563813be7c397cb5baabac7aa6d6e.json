Based on cutting-edge scientific research and interviews withover 100 genuinely happy people--and illustrated with inspiring stories--HAPPY FOR NO REASON lays out a powerful, holistic seven-step plan for increasing our level of happiness.\n\nTrue happiness is a lasting, neuro-physiological state of peace and well-being. It&amp;#039;s not based on what we have or do--or on any external reason or circumstance. Marci&amp;#039;s research reveals that we all have a happiness set-point. No matter what happens--good or bad--we tend to return to our pre-set range of happiness. And, just like turning up a thermostat, we can actually reprogram our happiness setting to a higher level. This eye-opening guidebook offers a practical program that will forever change how we create happiness in our lives.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:47f934c7eff563813be7c397cb5baabac7aa6d6e","amp;dn":"Marci+Shimoff-Happy+for+No+Reason","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"47f934c7eff563813be7c397cb5baabac7aa6d6e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,249,52,199,239,245,99,129,59,231,195,151,203,91,170,186,199,170,109,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
