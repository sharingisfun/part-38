You could almost say this show had three sets:  The first set, a mellow/bluesy second set featuring Scott Boyer and Tommy Talton of Cowboy, and a jamming third set.\n\nThe first set kicked off with the powerful combo of &quot;Hot'Lanta&quot; and &quot;Statesboro Blues.&quot;  The multi-tiered jams in &quot;Rockin' Horse&quot; make it one of the most adventurous and dynamic songs the ABB play, and this is no exception.  After a blast of the blues with &quot;Stormy Monday,&quot; with Gregg singing with authority, Derek's mysterious new instrumental &quot;Bag End&quot; hypnotized the crowd.  Warren's souflul &quot;River's Gonna Rise&quot; and an explosive &quot;Every Hungry WOman&quot; capped off a tight first set.\n\nNext came an extended mellow interlude that was like a set in itself.  Gregg held the crowd in the palm of his hand for &quot;Melissa,&quot; and then growled out the blues on &quot;Can't Be Satisfied&quot; from his recent solo album.  Scotty Boyer and Tommy Talton, who backed Gregg on his legendary On Tour album, then joined the ABB for beautiful renditions of &quot;Please Be With Me&quot; and &quot;All My Friends.&quot;  Tommy stayed on stage for a bluesy &quot;Hoochie Coochie Man,&quot; wrapping up the Cowboy mini-set in style.\n\nThe &quot;third set&quot; began next as the band took off on an epic &quot;Dreams,&quot; with Warren taking the main slide solo on a Gibson Les Paul that once belonged to Duane Allman.  Warren did Duane proud on this one!  &quot;Revival&quot; was jammed out to the extreme, with the &quot;JaMaBuBu&quot; drum/bass segment in the middle, before returing to a joyous conclusion.\n\nThis show also marked the first &quot;Whipping Post&quot; encore of the 2011 Beacon run, and this version is fierce and takes no prisoners! \n\nDisc One\n\n1.
