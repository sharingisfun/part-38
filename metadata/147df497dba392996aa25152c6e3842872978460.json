Upon entering the new world, the trio comes across the character of Forry, a flying dinosaur who can&amp;#039;t fly. His knowledge of Dinosaur World proves useful, as he guides the three kids to Tar Town, where they join up with Rex and Tops, two dinosaur freedom fighters willing to ignite a revolution against the villain, Mr. Big, and his evil caveman pawns, &quot;The Rockies.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:147df497dba392996aa25152c6e3842872978460","amp;dn":"RARE+Movie+-+Adventures+in+Dinosaur+City+%281992%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"147df497dba392996aa25152c6e3842872978460","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,125,244,151,219,163,146,153,106,162,81,82,198,227,132,40,114,151,132,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
