The film, directed and choreographed by Busby Berkeley, is considered a camp classic. It is noted for its use of musical numbers with fruit hats.\n\nMusical highlights include Carmen Miranda performing an insinuating, witty version of &quot;You Discover You're in New York&quot; that lampoons fads, fashions, and wartime shortages of the time. The film is also memorable for Miranda's &quot;The Lady in the Tutti Frutti Hat&quot;, which because of its sexual innuendo (dozens of scantily clad women handling very large bananas), prevented the film from being shown in Miranda's native Portugal in its initial release. Even in the US the censors dictated that the chorus girls must hold the bananas at the waist and not at the hip. Alice Faye sings &quot;A Journey to a Star,&quot; &quot;No Love, No Nothin',&quot; and the surreal finale &quot;The Polka-Dot Polka.&quot;\n\nThe film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Art Direction-Interior Decoration, Color (James Basevi, Joseph C. Wright, Thomas Little). It was the last musical Faye made as a Hollywood superstar. She was pregnant with her second daughter during filming.\n\n    CAST:-\n    Alice Faye as Eadie Allen\n    Carmen Miranda as Dorita\n    Phil Baker as Phil Baker\n    Benny Goodman as Himself\n    Benny Goodman Orchestra as Themselves\n    Eugene Pallette as Andrew Mason Sr.\n    Charlotte Greenwood as Mrs. Peyton Potter\n    Edward Everett Horton as Peyton Potter\n    Tony DeMarco as Himself\n    James Ellison as Andy Mason\n    Sheila Ryan as Vivian Potter\n    Dave Willock as Sgt.

A young soldier, Sgt. Andy Mason (James Ellison) meets Eadie Allen (Alice Faye), a New York City nightclub singer. The two fall in love. Unbeknownst to Eadie, Andy is unofficially engaged to long-time friend Vivian Potter (Sheila Ryan). Andy goes to war and returns a hero. His father (Eugene Pallette) arranges to have Eadie and her fellow nightclub performers (Carmen Miranda, Benny Goodman, Phil Baker, and dancer Tony DeMarco) appear in a war-bond drive at the estate of Vivian's parents, Mr. and Mrs. Peyton Potter (Charlotte Greenwood and Edward Everett Horton). It is during rehearsals that Eadie learns the truth about Andy's relationship with Vivian. The clouds vanish and the lovers unite when Vivian decides she wants a career as a dancer rather than marriage. The film ends with everyone living happily ever after.\n\nNoted drummer Louie Bellson appears uncredited in the Benny Goodman Orchestra while Carmen Miranda sings &quot;Paducah\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:-\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 855 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 640x480\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 23.976\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams:  2\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime 80 mins\nSubtitles: NONE\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]\nDuration: 80 mins\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cdbe2a7a78871ddd9803e7400cbf3c9e88f37b56","amp;dn":"The+Gang%27s+All+Here+%281943%29+Xvid+1cd+-++Alice+Faye%2C+Carmen+Mirand","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cdbe2a7a78871ddd9803e7400cbf3c9e88f37b56","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,190,42,122,120,135,29,221,152,3,231,64,12,191,60,158,136,243,123,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
