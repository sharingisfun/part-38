He takes a ride in  \n    an English Electric Lightning and flies 18 km up to the   \n    top of earth's atmosphere, where he sees the darkness      \n    of space above and the thin blue line of our atmosphere   \n    below. In the Namib desert in south-west Africa, he      \n    tells the story of Mercury. This tiny planet was          \n    stripped naked of its early atmosphere and is fully        \n    exposed to the ferocity of space.                         \n                                                             \n    Against the stunning backdrop of the glaciers of Alaska   \n    Brian reveals his fourth wonder: Saturn's moon Titan,      \n    shrouded by a murky, thick atmosphere. He reveals that    \n    below the clouds lies a magical world. Titan is the      \n    only place beyond earth where we've found liquid          \n    pooling on the surface in vast lakes, as big as the        \n    Caspian Sea, but the lakes of Titan are filled with a     \n    mysterious liquid, and are quite unlike anything on      \n    earth.                                                    \n                                                               \n                                                              \n                                                                 \n      \n\n      \n            .  . ..: RiPPER/RELEASE NOTES :.. .  .           \n                                                              \n                                                               \n                                                              \n                                                             \n                                                              \n                                                               \n                                                              \n                                                             \n      \n\n                                             \n                  ..: GROUP NEWS/CONTACT :..  \n                                                           \n                                                      \n       SFM is dedicated to bringing you high quality     \n      TVRips and DVDRips of popular series and movies for   \n                     your viewing pleasure!                 \n                                                           \n       We are currently looking for:                       \n       - 100+ Mbit EU dump site for exclusive SFM usage   \n       - HDTV/PDTV cappers                                \n       - Crates &amp; Kegs of Beer (full of course)          \n                                                         \n                  .  . ..: GREETZ :.. .  .","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f82a2e1b74526f1125aaefb1507e26dc7994563","amp;dn":"Wonders.Of.The.Solar.System.S01E03.720p.HDTV.x264-SFM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f82a2e1b74526f1125aaefb1507e26dc7994563","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,130,162,225,183,69,38,241,18,90,174,251,21,7,226,109,199,153,69,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
