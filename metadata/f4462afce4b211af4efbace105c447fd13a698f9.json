Tracks such as &quot;Knees&quot; offer dynamic moodiness unheard of in most of the band's peers, and even when they do get more traditional, it's led with such a great riff, like on &quot;Radiation Suit,&quot; or overwhelming catchiness, as on &quot;Now or Never,&quot; so as not to detract from enjoyment. Comparisons to Weezer  are a little unfounded this time out, however; Hot Rod Circuit may be geeks, but that doesn't make disc number three geek rock. \n\n\nAudio CD\n\nReleased: March 12, 2002\n\nLabel: Vagrant Records\n\nGenre: Rock\n\nStyle: Indie Rock\n\nQuality: FLAC\n\nAllmusic rating: 3.5 / 5 stars\n\n\n\nTracks:\n\n1.  \tPharmacist  \t \t\n2. \tAt Natures Mercy \t\t\n3. \tRadiation Suit \t\t\n4. \tSafely \t\t\n5. \tNow or Never \t\t\n6. \tCool for One Night \t\t\n7. \tKnees \t\t\n8. \tLet's Go Home \t\t\n9. \tConsumed by Laziness \t\t\n10. \tGet What You Get \t\t\n11. \tNight They Blew up the Moon \t\t\n\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f4462afce4b211af4efbace105c447fd13a698f9","amp;dn":"Hot+Rod+Circuit+-+Sorry+About+Tomorrow+%282002%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f4462afce4b211af4efbace105c447fd13a698f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,70,42,252,228,178,17,175,78,251,172,225,5,196,71,253,19,166,152,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
