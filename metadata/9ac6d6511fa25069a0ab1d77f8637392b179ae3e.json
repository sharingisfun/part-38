While trying to get out of a storm when driving the Looney Duney, they entered an old house where the longcase clock was wrong. Upon setting the clock to midnight, it released two ghosts: a Revolutionary War-era ghost named Jonathan Wellington &quot;Mudsy&quot; Muddlemore and his cat, Boo. The two stumbled upon two Redcoats and ended up hiding inside the clock during the Revolutionary War, but then couldn't get out and eventually died inside. Ever since being freed by their new friends, Mudsy and Boo have accompanied them on many mysteries, always giving an invisible helping hand.\n\n\n\nTech:\n\n\nVideo             : AVC at 1.554 Kb/s\nAspect            : 640 x 480 (1.333) at 29.970 fps\nFormat            : Matroska at 1.977 Kb/s\nLength            : 315 MB for 22 min. 18s 471ms\n\nAudio             : AC-3 at 192 Kb/s\nInfo              : 2 channels, 48,0 KHz\nLanguage          : English\n\nAudio             : AC-3 at 192 Kb/s\nInfo              : 2 channels, 48,0 KHz\nLanguage          : Portuguese\n\n\nScreeny: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/99cb2789a0cfc21d0b6b9eee942bc7e6d0fb216d.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/99cb2789a0cfc21d0b6b9eee942bc7e6d0fb216d.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ac6d6511fa25069a0ab1d77f8637392b179ae3e","amp;dn":"The+Funky+Phantom-DVDrip-zombiRG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ac6d6511fa25069a0ab1d77f8637392b179ae3e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,198,214,81,31,162,80,105,160,171,29,119,248,99,115,146,177,121,174,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
