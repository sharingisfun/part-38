Tobin has created the finest, most intense work of his very considerable career, an extension and refinement of everything he has achieved thus far.\n\nThe deluxe edition package will come with a full colour 10&quot; x 7&quot;  hardback book, which features exclusive images of the ISAM collaborative installation between Amon and Saatchi collection artist Tessa Farmer. The book also incorporates exclusive interviews with both Amon Tobin and Tessa Farmer, on the themes and inspiration behind ISAM, and on their groundbreaking project together. \n\nListen to the entire Amon Tobin discography for free at: http://www.amontobin.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:31c7f57955ed211f25679a2c7bf8686276745b90","amp;dn":"Amon+Tobin+-+ISAM+%28FLAC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"31c7f57955ed211f25679a2c7bf8686276745b90","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,199,245,121,85,237,33,31,37,103,154,44,123,248,104,98,118,116,91,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
