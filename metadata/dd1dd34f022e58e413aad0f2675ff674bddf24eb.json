(48 kbps / 44 kHz Mono, Fraunhofer CBR using jetAudio 6+).\n\n\nIt's a great pity A A Milne never wrote any more crime stories because if this one is anything to go by they would have been excellent reads. Here we have the essential ingredients for a classic murder - body in the study and a limited range of suspects. Along comes Tony who has always had a sneaking desire to emulate Sherlock Holmes. Fortunately his friend Bill, whilst staying in the house, is ruled out as a suspect because he was playing golf. Bill is more than willing to play Watson to Tony's Holmes and they set about investigating the crime. First published in 1922 this book is still well worth reading today. Whilst the style is a little dated, anyone who has read Dorothy L Sayers, or any of the other Golden Age writers will have no problem with it. This is a classic story which deserves to be more widely known today.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd1dd34f022e58e413aad0f2675ff674bddf24eb","amp;dn":"The+Red+House+Mystery+-+A.+A.+Milne++%28Unabridged%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd1dd34f022e58e413aad0f2675ff674bddf24eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,29,211,79,2,46,88,228,19,170,208,242,103,95,246,116,189,223,36,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
