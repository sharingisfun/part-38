Who do you think it could be?\n\nOne thing is certain: there are plenty of surprises in store when My Kitchen Rules launches in 2013.\n\nManu Feildel and Pete Evans return to host and judge the ultimate home-cooking battle as they accept dinner party invites in each state across the country.\n\nThis series they welcome new guest judge Colin Fassnidge to the table alongside returning guest judges Guy Grossi, Karen Martini and Liz Egan.\n\nIt's state versus state, plate against plate, as teams of two attempt to out-dine and out-wine each other to see whose kitchen rules.\n\nEach team will take turns to transform an ordinary home into an instant restaurant for one pressure cooker night. They'll serve up a three course menu designed to impress not only their fellow contestants but our esteemed judges.\n\nThere will be triumphs, kitchen fires, laughter, tears and plenty of opinionated guests as they battle the clock and their nerves to plate up on time.\n\nThe top two teams will again battle it out in the grand final where they will present their ultimate dining menu to a full restaurant.\n\nWith $250,000 in prize money on offer, the knives will definitely be out.\n\nGroup 2 - Domestic goddesses\nCupcakes, pretty things and romance are Jenna and Joanna's great loves. But beneath the prettiness lies iron-willed determination.\n\nJenna, 25, credits her fianceÃŒï¿½ Tyson and his family for helping to turn her life around. His mother, Shirley, happened to be the business partner of Joanna's mother. (They are bridal designers in Adelaide.) And that is how Jenna, and Joanna, 27, became friends.\nBut for this Adelaide twosome, &quot;Food bonded us,&quot; says Joanna, who is third generation Italian.\n\n&quot;My mum and Shirley get together and make bread, as in 50 loaves, and once a year, huge batches of pasta sauce,&quot; explains Joanna. &quot;It all gets given away, goes to the neighbours and others. It's an all-day thing and Jenna's come in on the Italian traditions.&quot;\n\nJenna works in a cake shop and has a cupcake business on the side which she hopes to expand.\n\nShe's learning a lot about making dreams reality from Joanna, who, with her husband, runs a barbecue manufacturing business called G-Spit. They also make a range of barbecue seasonings.\n\n&quot;Jenna and I feed off each other and inspire each other, &quot;Ã¢â‚¬Â¨says Joanna. &quot;We both know we're going in the same direction.&quot;\n\nBoth love to cook, of course. &quot;We may not be the best, but we love it,&quot; says Joanna. &quot;My aunty taught me to cook Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Sicilian cooking. Generally at home we eat Italian food but we try everything. We like South American grilling.&quot;\n\nJenna is the sweets girl, but she will try her hand at everything, particularly as she has some pretty clear dreams of beingÃ¢â‚¬Â¨a homemaker.\n\nJoanna has two kids, four and two, and was married Ã¢â‚¬Â¨at 21. &quot;We just knew we were right for each other. Ã¢â‚¬Â¨At the time it was a case of when you know, you know.&quot;\nJenna loves that idea. &quot;I love to feed my fianceÃŒï¿½. If I could be a fulltime stay-at-home mum and cook and clean Ã¢â‚¬Â¨all day I would. I really love to cook and clean. WhenÃ¢â‚¬Â¨ it's appreciated it makes me feel nurtured and it makes me happy to be able to nurture people.\n\n&quot;I love the idea of everyone leaving for the day and coming home to a clean house and the smell of good food in the oven.&quot;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd975254d7e5defd3218d21a618eab1b3853aa4f","amp;dn":"My.Kitchen.Rules.AU.S04E12.WS.PDTV.XviD.BF1.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd975254d7e5defd3218d21a618eab1b3853aa4f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,151,82,84,215,229,222,253,50,24,210,26,97,142,171,27,56,83,170,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
