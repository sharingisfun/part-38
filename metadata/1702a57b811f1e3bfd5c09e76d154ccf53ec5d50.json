The rest of the group must    \n      bail Kenny out before Nasty Nate gets to him. The group decides    \n     to sell marijuana that Thurgood gets through his job as a janitor   \n        at a pharmaceutical lab. They become pals with rap star Sir      \n     Smoke-A-Lot and the rivals of dealer Samson Simpson. On the side,   \n      Thurgood seeks the love of Mary Jane, an anti-pot daughter of a    \n      dealer. What follows is typical pothead behaviour with a ton of    \n                           cameos.
