My Favorite Things was destined to be the most remembered and influential of these, and while Coltrane Plays the Blues is not as renowned or daring in material, it is still a powerful session. As for the phrase &quot;plays the blues&quot; in the title, that's not an indicator that the tunes are conventional blues (they aren't). It's more indicative of a bluesy sensibility, whether he is playing muscular saxophone or, on &quot;Blues to Bechet&quot; and &quot;Mr. Syms,&quot; the more unusual sounding (at the time) soprano sax. Elvin Jones, who hadn't been in Coltrane's band long, really busts out on the quicker numbers, such as &quot;Blues to You&quot; and &quot;Mr. Day.&quot; [Some reissues add five bonus tracks: two alternates apiece of &quot;Blues to Elvin&quot; and &quot;Blues to You,&quot; and &quot;Untitled Original (Exotica).&quot; \n\nTrack listing\n\n\n    A1 Blues to Elvin 7:52\n    A2 Blues to Bechet 5:44\n    A3 Blues to You 6:25\n    B1 Mr. Day 7:56\n    B2 Mr. Syms 5:19\n    B3 Mr. Knight 7:30 \n\n Some reissues add five bonus tracks: two alternates apiece of &quot;Blues to Elvin&quot; and &quot;Blues to You,&quot; and &quot;Untitled Original&quot; (Exotica).\n\n\nPersonnel: \n\nJohn Coltrane (soprano &amp; tenor saxophones); \nMcCoy Tyner (piano); \nSteve Davis (acoustic bass); \nElvin Jones (drums).\nRecorded at Atlantic Studios, New York, New York on October 24, 1960.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c441a87774e8d6671e5955461cb4021057b169a","amp;dn":"John+Coltrane+-+Plays+the+blues+%5BEAC+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c441a87774e8d6671e5955461cb4021057b169a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,68,26,135,119,78,141,102,113,229,149,84,97,203,64,33,5,123,22,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
