What are My Ã¢â‚¬ËœRiskÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Factors? Why DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t We Get Ã¢â‚¬ËœCareÃ¢â‚¬â„¢? Is the Public Good Ã¢â‚¬ËœGoodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ for Me? \nWho Profits from My Health? and WhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Politics Got to Do with It? Provides readers with specific tools which\n which to better navigate the healthcare system Translates what we know about communication and health into \nuseful guidelines for everyday practice Includes discussions of politics and healthcare, genetic testing, and \nalternative care.\n\nNow Americans are not so confident. Surveys show that health care is the number one concern among voters\n today.  The cry for Federal legislation to protect patientsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ rights reflects a growing anxiety about\n qualityÃ¢â‚¬â€fear that we wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get the care we need when we need it.\n\nAnd researchers have confirmed that our fears are valid. The quality of health care in this country is\n not ideal: quality varies widely across health plans and providers. Many procedures and therapies are\n used too often while others are not used often enough. No institution or office is free from errors. \nAnd these problems are pervasive. Although most of the information we have comes from managed care\n\n organizations, we now see that quality is uneven throughout the industryÃ¢â‚¬â€not only in health plans,\n but also in physiciansÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ offices, nursing homes, hospitals, and home health care agencies.\n\nWhat makes this National anxiety especially powerful is how little we really know. We may be aware\n that some health plans and some providers deliver poor quality care, but the real issue for people \nis much more personal. What about my health plan? How good is my doctor? How do I choose among the \noptions available to me?\n\n[/color][/b]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[img]http://torrent-stats.info/ad8b/13a030052.png[/img]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:39ec5dd79b9b9c1444c2ad8b5dae4967d1dd9637","amp;dn":"Talking+About+Health+-+Mantesh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"39ec5dd79b9b9c1444c2ad8b5dae4967d1dd9637","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,236,93,215,155,155,156,20,68,194,173,139,93,174,73,103,209,221,150,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
