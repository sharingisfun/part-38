This recording combines two internet radio rebroadcasts. The first was from 2013 in which Premier Radio cut two of the &quot;Oldies&quot; Casey originally played:\n\n&quot;Little Ole Man&quot; by Bill Cosby (between chart positions 23 and 22) and,\n\n&quot;Satisfaction&quot; by the Rolling Stones (between chart positions 2 and 1).\n\nIn the second (from 2014) Premier restored the two &quot;Oldies&quot; all songs from the original but made other minor edits (my assistant Amy insisted on including an example). So Mrs. RocketMan's favorite son went through both versions and put Humpty Dumpty back together again.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nIn this very first broadcast (which uses the data for the week ending July 11th, 1970):\n\nWilson Pickett re-does an Archies song.\n\nThere is a vocal group that has had 32 hits in the last 9 years.\n\nOne song in the countdown has been a hit four different times in 19 years.\n\nCasey remembers the 200th birthday of a man who has a piece of music in this countdown.\n\nCasey also celebrates the 70th birthday of the man who stopped the Beatles.\n\nWith artists like the Moody Blues, Mountain, Rare Earth, Blood Sweat &amp; Tears, the Carpenters, Bread, Three Dog Night, Blues Image, and the Beatles (who are still together), its a great countdown.\n\n40: End of Our Road - Marvin Gaye\n39: Silver Bird - Mark Lindsey\n38: Spill the Wine - Eric Burden &amp; War\n37: Go Back - Crabby Appleton\n36: I Just Can't Help Believing - B.J.
