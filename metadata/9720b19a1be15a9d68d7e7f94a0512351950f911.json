Some say that the Syldoon eat virgins and babiesÃ¢â‚¬â€œor perhaps their own mothers. Arkamondos, a bookish young scribe, suspects that the SyldoonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dire reputation may have grown in the retelling, but heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s about to find out for himself.\n\nHired to chronicle the exploits of a band of rugged Syldoon warriors, Arki finds himself both frightened and fascinated by the menÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s enigmatic leader, Captain Braylar Killcoin. A secretive, mercurial figure haunted by the memories of those heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s killed with his deadly flail, Braylar has already disposed of at least one impertinent scribe ... and Arki might be next.\n\nArchiving the mundane doings of millers and merchants was tedious, but at least it was safe. As Arki heads off on a mysterious mission into parts unknown, in the company of the coarse, bloody-minded Syldoon, he is promised a chance to finally record an historic adventure well worth the telling, but first he must survive the experience!\n\nFormat: E-pub ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9720b19a1be15a9d68d7e7f94a0512351950f911","amp;dn":"Bloodsounders+Arc+Book1%3A+Scourge+of+the+Betrayers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9720b19a1be15a9d68d7e7f94a0512351950f911","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,32,177,154,27,225,90,157,104,215,231,249,74,5,18,53,25,80,249,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
