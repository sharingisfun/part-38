There, Magic Priest Trainees monitor demonic activity and report immediately whenever demons head for Earth.  Unfortunately, the demons are very elusive and sneak past the HINTERLAND's sensors on a regular basis.  How?  Nobody knows.\n\nThanks goes to Talon13184 for this release.\n\nDon't know how to view this comic book?
