Now, in the vein of Jeffrey SachsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s &quot;The End of Poverty&quot;, Richard StearnsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s &quot;The Hole in Our Gospel&quot;, and Gregory BoyleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s &quot;Tattoos on the Heart&quot;, his groundbreaking &quot;Toxic Charity&quot; shows us how to start serving needy and impoverished members of our communities in a way that will lead to lasting, real-world change.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7fcabe23e49bce46e703e9331a9b566a0dbe435d","amp;dn":"Toxic+Charity+%28Robert+D.+Lupton%29+Retail+epub+%5BItzy%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7fcabe23e49bce46e703e9331a9b566a0dbe435d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,202,190,35,228,155,206,70,231,3,233,51,26,155,86,106,13,190,67,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
