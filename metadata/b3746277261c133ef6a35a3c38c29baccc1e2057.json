After a freak accident infuses him with the power of super-speed, Turbo kicks into overdrive and embarks on an extraordinary journey to achieve the seemingly impossible: competing in the world's fastest race, the Indianapolis 500. With the help of his tricked-out streetwise snail crew, this ultimate underdog puts his heart and shell on the line to prove that no dream is too big, and no dreamer too small.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b3746277261c133ef6a35a3c38c29baccc1e2057","amp;dn":"Turbo+%282013%29+720p","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b3746277261c133ef6a35a3c38c29baccc1e2057","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,116,98,119,38,28,19,62,246,163,90,60,56,194,155,172,204,30,32,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
