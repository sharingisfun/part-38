He has dreams of starting his own business. One day he meets Aruna at a friends wedding and slowly fall in love. Aruna is daughter of a very successful lawyer. Ajay uses his rich friend's car, apartment etc. to impress Aruna's family, in the hope that he will succeed in his own business before they are married. However, Ajay falls prey to the cut throat competion in business and loses all his investment. He discloses everything to Aruna. Aruna is sympathetic to Ajay and loves him for what he is. However, Aruna's lawyer dad turns down the marriage proposal and starts to prosecute Ajay for business fraud. Through his hard work and support from Aruna and his mother, Ajay is able to correct the wrong doings and is able to win over Aruna's father. \n\nAmitabh Bachchan's acting prowess is what strikes you when u watch Manzil. This movie is of the period when the thespian was labelled as &quot;an angry young man&quot; and the other movies showed him as such. But this movie is so different. So much economy of movement. An entire song is shown as the actor playing the harmonium with downcast eyes and barely moving his hands. His body language is terrific even when his back is towards the camera. All his dialogs are in close-up and his face changes expression in seconds. It may not be a very well known movie of his but the utmost subtlety with which Amitabh Bachchan acts (does he really ?, it never seems so) proves beyond doubt that he was and still is miles ahead of every 1 else in Bollywood.\n\nManzil has the eternally superhit rain song, Rhim Jhim Gire Saawan sung by Kishoreda. But my favoutite lifetime best rain song is Rhim Jhim Gire Saawan sung by Lata Didi. Especially the picturisation of this song on a rain drenched Amitabh &amp; Moushami whispering sweet nothings on the wooden seat facing the sea shore  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/LoFKP.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/LoFKP.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n(This scene was probably shot on the marine drive promenade in south Mumbai).\n\nCast:\nAmitabh Bachchan\nMoushumi Chatterjee\nA K Hangal\nRakesh Pandey\nSatyen Kappu\nLalita Pawar\n\nMedia Info :\nLanguage - Hindi (Indian)\nVideo Size - 1.04 GB\nVideo Codec - AVC\nVideo Res - 640 x 480\nVideo Frame Rate - 29.970 fps \nVideo Bitrate - 1300 Kbps\nSubtitles - English (Hardcoded)\nAudio Codec - AC3\nChannels - 5.1 Channel\nSample Rate - 48000 Hz @ 384 kbps\nLength - 1 Hour 54 mins\n\nPoster: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/Wp6gY.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/Wp6gY.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nScreens : &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/VhDH2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/VhDH2.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/AqIUi.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/AqIUi.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/Xqck9.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/Xqck9.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/psy2X.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/psy2X.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/CJEZM.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/CJEZM.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/L0l9M.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/L0l9M.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/D1SzW.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/D1SzW.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/LY4QG.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/LY4QG.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:89210bb5680b3dd97d3d0e87ad8df95f494902b0","amp;dn":"Manzil+%7C+1979+%7C+Hindi+Romance+%7C+Xvid+AC3+%7C+E-Subs+%7C+Phantom","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"89210bb5680b3dd97d3d0e87ad8df95f494902b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,33,11,181,104,11,61,217,125,61,14,135,173,141,249,95,73,73,2,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
