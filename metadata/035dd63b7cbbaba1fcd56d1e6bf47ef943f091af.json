But it's the latter ones who make you scratch your head and say, 'What in the world were you thinking?'\n\nFormer Saturday Night Live writer Leland Gregory skewers cruel crooks and the idiotically inane.\n\nFrom absurd 911 calls to presidential philosophizing and political pandering to foolish felons, Leland Gregory generates the best laughs by exposing the worst of human nature. Inside this collection, Gregory offers more than 275 accounts of human stupidity at its most malicious and peculiar:\n\n* In August 2006, 40-year-old Darrel Rodgers was treated at a Bloomington, Indiana, hospital for a self-inflicted gunshot wound to his left knee. Rogers explained that he shot himself seeking to relieve the pain in his knee, which probably stemmed from shooting himself in the same knee ten years earlier.\n\n* And, because some of the stories are just that unbelievable, each anecdote, quote, or factoid is presented with relevant background information--including its verified news source.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:035dd63b7cbbaba1fcd56d1e6bf47ef943f091af","amp;dn":"Leland+Gregory+-+Cruel+And+Unusual+Idiots+%28mobi+%2B+epub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"035dd63b7cbbaba1fcd56d1e6bf47ef943f091af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,93,214,59,124,187,171,161,252,213,109,30,107,244,126,249,67,240,145,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
