J. N. Priestley, F. Seible and G. M. Calvi\n\nProduct Description\nBecause of their structural simplicity, bridges tend to be particularly vulnerable to damage and even collapse when subjected to earthquakes or other forms of seismic activity. Recent earthquakes, such as the ones in Kobe, Japan, and Oakland, California, have led to a heightened awareness of seismic risk and have revolutionized bridge design and retrofit philosophies.\n\nIn Seismic Design and Retrofit of Bridges, three of the world's top authorities on the subject have collaborated to produce the most exhaustive reference on seismic bridge design currently available. Following a detailed examination of the seismic effects of actual earthquakes on local area bridges, the authors demonstrate design strategies that will make these and similar structures optimally resistant to the damaging effects of future seismic disturbances.\nProduct Details\nHardcover: 704 pages\nPublisher: Wiley-Interscience; 1 edition (March 29, 1996)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 047157998X\nISBN-13: 978-0471579984\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d06557e4c1b8b93a0722187601f921c43822d2bf","amp;dn":"Seismic+Design+and+Retrofit+of+Bridges+by+M.+J.+N.+Priestley%2C+F.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d06557e4c1b8b93a0722187601f921c43822d2bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,101,87,228,193,184,185,58,7,34,24,118,1,249,33,196,56,34,210,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
