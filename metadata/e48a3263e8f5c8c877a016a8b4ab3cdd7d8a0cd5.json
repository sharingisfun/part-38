Written by P.G. Wodehouse; Full-cast dramatisation; Dramatised by Archie Scottney.\n\nCharming Earl of Ickenham (Uncle Fred) has received a plea from affably dotty Lord Emsworth to help foil a plot to steal his prize-winning pig. And to examine the sanity of eccentric Duke of Dunstable.\n\nDelighting in such entertainment, Uncle Fred arrives at Blandings in the guise of &quot;brain specialist&quot; Glossop, with nephew Pongo posing as his secretary. Lively Polly Pott is the third imposter, secretly engaged to Dunstable's nephew Ricky and hoping to charm her prospective uncle-in-law. Emsworth's devious secretary Rupert Baxter spots them but can't call their bluff for fear of blackmail. Emsworth's sister Connie suspects they are jewel thieves. Bosham, Emsworth's son, thinks all is above board. But then Polly's detective Dad is called in. Will the pig-napping happen?\n\nCast:\nUncle Fred ..... Alfred Molina\nLady Constance .....
