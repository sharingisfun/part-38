Lewis. The film stars Peggy Cummins, John Dall, Berry Kroeger, Morris Carnovsky and Anabel Shaw. It has also been released under the title: Deadly Is the Female. \nOur overall rating for Gun Crazy is: very good, a genuinely well-made film that has many impressive qualities - stands up to repeated viewing\n[img]http://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/1024x768q90/842/9own.jpg[/img]\nExplosive, breakneck, combustible and sexy, Gun Crazy is a roller coaster ride with more ups than downs - a vicarious dive into sin that crackles with a kinetic energy that grabs you by the throat from the credits and never lets up\n[img]http://www.freeimage.us/image-3901_53586652.jpg[/img]\nWhile 1940s cinema was packed with devious dames, few can match Peggy CumminsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hellcat sharpshooter Laurie Starr for sheer manipulative allure. Meeting Laurie at a small-town carny, clean-cut gun nut Bart (a perplexed John Dall) is transfixed by her charms and prowess with a pistol. The two cut a swathe through the Southern states, holding up banks and evading a tightening police dragnet.\n[img]http://www.freeimage.us/image-D982_53586652.jpg[/img]\nÃ¢â‚¬ËœGun CrazyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is a magnificently enjoyable film, distinguished by Joseph H LewisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s restless, catch-all directorial style; visually, the film ranges from classic gritty noir to hyperstylised modern gothic, to a startling single-take hold-up sequence shot on crowded streets. The filmmakers never miss a chance for a sly Freudian aside: from BartÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s little problem with guns (he can point, but he canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t shoot) to LaurieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s zealous lust for control, Ã¢â‚¬ËœGun CrazyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is awash with hysterical symbolism. A genuine treat.\n[img]http://www.freeimage.us/image-C111_53586652.jpg[/img]\nPrefiguring the Starkweather-Fugate murder spree of the late 1950s, during which Charlie Starkweather and girlfriend Caril Fugate(14 years old) carried out 11 killingsThese two are said to have got their inspiration from Gun Crazy in-turn they inspired the movies Natural Born Killers, Badlands and Wild at Heart. \n[img]http://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/1024x768q90/841/rr8wi.jpg[/img]\nCaril Ann Fugate, left, and Charles Starkweather in 1958\n\nVIDEO\nSize.... 0.97b\nDuration.... 01:35:25\nCodec.......
