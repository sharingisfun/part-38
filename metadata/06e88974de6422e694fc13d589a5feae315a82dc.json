During their weekly date night, they impetuously steal a dinner reservation, which leads to a case of mistaken identity. Turns out the reservation was for a pair of thieves, and now a number of unsavory characters want Phil and Claire killed. If they can survive a wacky life-threatening night, they may just rediscover the passion missing from their marriage. Directed by Shawn Levy, the film co-stars Mark Wahlberg, James Franco, and Kristen Wiig.\n\nRipped with DVD Decrypter and Autogk.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:06e88974de6422e694fc13d589a5feae315a82dc","amp;dn":"Date+Night%282010%29DVD+Rip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"06e88974de6422e694fc13d589a5feae315a82dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,232,137,116,222,100,34,230,148,252,19,213,137,165,254,174,49,90,130,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
