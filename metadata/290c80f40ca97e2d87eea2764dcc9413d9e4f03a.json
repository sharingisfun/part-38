So hold your nose, kiss the babies, and just think how good you would look on a stamp. A stamp, for mailÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ No, not email, mail. Never mind, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll explain later.\n\nNow, before we go into your media responsibilities, you must understand the true history of political power, so you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t accidentally act on the naÃƒÂ¯ve idealism you are required to project to the general public.\n\nAbout the author:\nStefan Molyneux is a Canadian philosopher, author, speaker, and host of Freedomain Radio. Molyneux's areas of focus include libertarian political philosophy, voluntaryism based on the strict application of the non-aggression principle, secular ethics, strong atheism, cryptocurrency (Bitcoin), history, non-violent parenting, and familial relationship issues.
