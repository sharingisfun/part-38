A co-worker may quietly undermine your efforts while professing to be helpful, or your boss may prey on your weaknesses. Manipulative people have two goals: to win and to loog good doing it. Often those they abuse are only vaguely aware of what is happening to them. In this eye-opening book, you'll also discover * four reasons why victims have a hard time leaving abusie relationships, * power tactics manipulative people use to push their own agendas and justify their behavior, * ways to redefine the rules of engagement between you and the abuser, * how to spot potential weaknesses in your character that can set you up for manipulation, * 2 tools for personal empowerment to help you maintain greater strength in all relationships, and much more.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0bbded199c77e380cc33765eaed614c6a8362e5a","amp;dn":"In+Sheeps+Cothing+by+George+Simon","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0bbded199c77e380cc33765eaed614c6a8362e5a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,189,237,25,156,119,227,128,204,51,118,94,174,214,20,198,168,54,46,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
