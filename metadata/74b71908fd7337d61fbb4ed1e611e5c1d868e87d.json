Today,\nfive years on and with over 11,500 releases to look back  on  Seek  n\nDestroy are a well and truly established  team  that  have  surpassed\nwhat many had thought would be just another  minor  team  that  would\ndisappear as quickly as it came. The majority of the original members\nwho helped to form and create Seek n Destroy have either  retired  or\nmoved on to other projects. What has made  Seek  n  Destroy  such  an\nenjoyable team to be a part of - at any time - is that many  new  and\ninteresting members have come forward sharing  the  same  dreams  and\ndesires as those original members to help keep pushing forward Seek n\nDestroy to new heights that it enjoys today. Seek n  Destroy  is  not\njust a crack team it is a family and being a family  I  think  it  is\nfair to say we look at each other with pride. We take  pride  knowing\nthat being a little bit different has made us that little bit better.\n\nAs a member once said, &quot;Not many teams do it to learn and at the same\ntime try and help others. Forgive the self-righteous attitude, but  I\nthink its fair to say that we rock most royally&quot;.\n\nLive the dream... Seek n Destroy... five years bolder...\n\nIf you are interested in becoming part of SnD and have knowledge  and\ncoding skills for developing crack intros and/or demos we would  love\nto hear from you. Positions are open for all talented people in  this\nfield.\n\nWe continue to look for quality crackers, keygenners  &amp;  unpackers  -\ncoders who can write quality tools  and  utilities  -  demo  &amp;  intro\ncoders  -  tutorial  authors  who  can  write  interesting  and  well\nstructured tutorials - mod/chiptune authors (.mod, .xm, etc. ) If you\nthink you can be part of a friendly team and help to contribute in to\na community then feel free to find us...\n\ngreetings\n\nOver the years we have come to know and  love  many  individuals  and\nmany teams. Some teams still stand today and some have  unfortunately\nfallen to bad times. We would like to take this opportunity to  thank\nand give a greeting to:  ArTeam,  CoolPHat,  CracksLatinoS,  Fixdown,\nICU, MP2k, PEDiY, Resurrection, REVENGE  Crew,  TSRh,  Unpack  China,\nVDown, and all at China  Serials2K  and  the  AstaLaVista  guys.
