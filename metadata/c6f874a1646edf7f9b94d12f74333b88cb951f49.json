The album was a great success, hitting number one on the charts for 8 nonconsecutive weeks in 1968. Columbia Records offered the band a new recording contract, but it took months to get through since they were still signed to Mainstream Records. The album features three cover songs (&quot;Summertime&quot;, &quot;Piece of My Heart&quot; and &quot;Ball and Chain&quot;). The album also features Bill Graham, who introduces the band at the beginning of &quot;Combination of the Two&quot;. &quot;Ball and Chain&quot; is the only song on the album recorded entirely live, and even though the cover credits assert that the live material was recorded at Bill Graham's Fillmore Auditorium, it was actually taken from a concert at the Winterland Ballroom in 1968. The album's overall raw sound effectively captures the band's energetic and lively concerts. The LP was released in both stereo and mono formats with the monophonic pressing now an ultra rare collector's item. The album had been considered for Quadraphonic format in the early 70's and eventually in 2002, was released as a Multichannel Sony SACD. The original Quadraphonic mix remains unreleased. \nThe cover was drawn by underground cartoonist Robert Crumb after the band's original cover idea, a picture of the group naked in bed together, was dropped by the record company. Crumb had originally intended his art for the LP back cover, with a portrait of Joplin to grace the front. But JoplinÃ¢â‚¬â€an avid fan of underground comics, especially the work of CrumbÃ¢â‚¬â€so loved the Cheap Thrills illustration that she demanded Columbia Records place it on the front cover. It is number nine on Rolling Stone's list of one hundred greatest album covers.  Initially, the album was to be called Sex, Dope and Cheap Thrills, but the title was not received well by Columbia Records.  A variation of the title on the cover is used as the logo for the Cheap Thrills record label, owned by British DJ HervÃƒÂ©. \nThe album was released in the summer of 1968, one year after their debut album, and reached #1 on the Billboard charts in its eighth week in October. It kept the #1 spot for eight (nonconsecutive) weeks while the single, &quot;Piece of My Heart&quot;, also became a huge hit. By the end of the year it was the most successful album of 1968, having sold nearly a million copies. The success was short-lived however, as Joplin left the group for a solo career in December 1968. In 2003, the album was ranked number 338 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. They previously ranked it #50 on their Top 100 Albums of the Past 20 Years list in 1987. It is often regarded as one of the key recordings of the late 1960s. It is also listed in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.  Outtakes originally to have appeared on the album have since been released on Janis Joplin compilations such as Farewell Song (In which Big Brother's original instruments were replaced with studio musicians from 1983, angering the band) and the Janis compilation box set featuring all original studio songs and live recordings. The 1999 re-release of Cheap Thrills features the outtakes &quot;Flower in the Sun&quot; and &quot;Roadblock&quot; as well as live performances of &quot;Magic of Love&quot; and &quot;Catch Me Daddy&quot; as bonus material..\n\nCD - Track Listings\n\n[01] Combination Of The Two\n[02] I Need A Man To Love\n[03] Summertime\n[04] Piece Of My Heart\n[05] Turtle Blues\n[06] Oh, Sweet Mary\n[07] Ball And Chain\n[08] Roadblock (Studio Outtake)\n[09] Flower In The Sun (Studio Outtake)\n[10] Catch Me Daddy (Live, Grande Ballroom, Detroit 02 March 1968\n[11] Magic Of Love (Live, Grande Ballroom, Detroit 02 March 1968)\n\n\tCD Play Time - 00h:55m:20s\n\nTotal File Size....................... 137mb (Including MP3s + M3u, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat &amp; Bitrate..................
