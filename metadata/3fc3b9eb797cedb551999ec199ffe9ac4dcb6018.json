One of the most popular and best-known Playboy pin-ups ever, Shannon Tweed burst on the scene in the 80s as Playmate of the Year and Hugh Hefner's love interest. She soon became a successful actress, appearing in countless movies and television series. She met Gene Simmons at a party at the Playboy Mansion, and they lived happily ever after with their two children, Nick and Sophie. Told in her own straightforward, no-holds-barred style, Kiss and Tell is a backstage pass to life at the Playboy Mansion, a behind-the-scenes view of one of the biggest rock stars in the world, and the experience of raising two kids in front of the camera.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3fc3b9eb797cedb551999ec199ffe9ac4dcb6018","amp;dn":"Shannon+Tweed+-+Kiss+and+Tell","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3fc3b9eb797cedb551999ec199ffe9ac4dcb6018","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,195,185,235,121,124,237,181,81,153,158,193,153,255,233,172,77,203,96,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
