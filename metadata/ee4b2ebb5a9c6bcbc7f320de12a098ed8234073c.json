Of course, her future self doesn't tell her who he is, just sends her into the abyss and straight into an alien invasion.\n\nHe turns out to be ConRad Smith, the callous, untrusting Commander of Earth's army and the world's last defense. There's only one way to know for sure if this strange woman is an alien spy, slice her throat. Except, he didn't anticipate the heat he would feel as he interrogates the hot-tempered, warm-blooded woman. For a man whose sole focus has been survival, she's more temptation than he can handle. But a world on the brink of destruction leaves no room for love;and time is running out. \n\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee4b2ebb5a9c6bcbc7f320de12a098ed8234073c","amp;dn":"K+C+Klein+-+Dark+Future%2C2011+epub%2Cmobi%2CKK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee4b2ebb5a9c6bcbc7f320de12a098ed8234073c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,75,46,187,90,156,107,203,199,243,32,222,18,160,152,237,130,52,7,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
