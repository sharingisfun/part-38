Amongst the many pianists who have been exponents of this genre, there are only a few who have had a lasting influence on the music scene. Perhaps the most well known boogie-woogie pianist is Albert Ammons. His &quot;Boogie Woogie Stomp&quot; released in 1936 was a pivotal recording, not just for boogie-woogie but for music. Some of the flattened sevenths in the right hand riffs are similar to licks used by early rock and roll guitarists. Ammons' two main compatriots were Meade 'Lux' Lewis and Pete Johnson. \n     The short film,&quot;Boogie Woogie Dream&quot; shot in 1941, but not released until 1944. contains the only known footage of Albert Ammons and Pete Johnson. The title number, &quot;Boogie Woogie Dream&quot; is one of the hottest boogie woogies ever recorded. \n            ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4a5883ee614b9ab4deda71a6c98f389954499a15","amp;dn":"HISTORY+OF+POP+AND+ROCK+MUSIC+-+part+469","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4a5883ee614b9ab4deda71a6c98f389954499a15","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,88,131,238,97,75,154,180,222,218,113,166,201,143,56,153,84,73,154,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
