rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7_Assassins&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIn the story, a group of government guards set out to recover a stash of stolen gold. The plot thickens however, when they discover a rebel leader is behind the theft and is attempting to use the gold to aid in efforts against their regime.\n A bandit leader is charged with the task of tracking him down. She has some success, but eventually he escapes to Gold Valley, where several warriors and persecuted civilians have already fled. The Bandits follow him there, but soon discover that capturing him will be a job easier said than done. Since the village is made up of several seasoned fighters, the bandits are unsuccessful at recovering him.\n The failure leads to the General in charge of the territory taking over. The battles become more intense. A couple of power struggles take place where the rebels and the government fight over the rebel leader, the gold, and in some cases, revenge is the motivation.\n\n7 Assassins was mostly a good viewing experience for me. It takes place in the early 1900s, so guns are in play. But it's also in a time period, where many fighters still have great skill with blades.\n So just because you bring a sword to a gun fight, doesn't mean you'll lose. The major skirmishes were good. There was a little wire work used, mostly when a fighter was hit. Sometimes he would fly back further than normal, due to the wires.\n That didn't bother me though. The individual battles were exciting and if you've been watching Chinese action films for awhile, you'll definitely see some faces from the past make an appearance in this film.\n\nWhile the fights were generally good, there were a couple of spots where the film slowed down. It was mostly due to character development, so I don't fault the film for that. There were also a couple of lengthy speeches given by the Gold Valley leader, that might have more impact on Chinese audience.\n Taking into account that this film was primarily made for a Chinese audience in the first place, that's understandable. It helps get them pumped up to see some of their well known actors building into the battle scenes.\n Also, when the battles occur, some of them fall in the skirmishes.\n\nAnother issue is the title of the film. It's labeled 7 Assassins, but this film's not about a person being assassinated. It's mostly about a power struggle between government officials and a rebel band. So don't expect to see a Magnificent 7 style film, with a Chinese flare.\n\nOne last area in the film I liked was how the bandit leader turned out to be a wildcard. There was definitely a defined line between the rebels and the government troops. But her group throws a little more spice into the conflict.\n They have self-interest in mind which almost causes a Spaghetti Western Standoff between the three groups. She appeared in the film mostly during the beginning and the end. But her group, definitely added to the story, in a good way.\n\n\nSCREENSHOTS:\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/RV5uQdN&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/RV5uQdN&lt;/a&gt;\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is personally brought to you by the Carjacker, from The Chop Shop.\nLeave your thoughts/opinions and ratings on the A/V of this film for others to see.
