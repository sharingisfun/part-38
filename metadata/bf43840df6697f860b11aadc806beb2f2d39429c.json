Lila, a doctor and an expectant mother, is so shattered by the spread of violence and infection that she continues to plan for her childÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s arrival even as society dissolves around her. Kittridge, known to the world as Ã¢â‚¬Å“Last Stand in Denver,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ has been forced to flee his stronghold and is now on the road, dodging the infected, armed but alone and well aware that a tank of gas will get him only so far. April is a teenager fighting to guide her little brother safely through a landscape of death and ruin. These three will learn that they have not been fully abandonedÃ¢â‚¬â€and that in connection lies hope, even on the darkest of nights.\n\nOne hundred years in the future, Amy and the others fight on for humankindÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s salvation . . . unaware that the rules have changed. The enemy has evolved, and a dark new order has arisen with a vision of the future infinitely more horrifying than manÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s extinction. If the Twelve are to fall, one of those united to vanquish them will have to pay the ultimate price.\n\nA literary thriller revealed in multiple time frames, The Twelve is a suspenseful tale of the human capacity for sacrifice and the transformative power of renewal. In the present day: As three strangers attempt to navigate the chaos cast upon civilization by a U.S. government experiment gone wrong, their destinies intertwine. More than a hundred years in the future: Amy, Peter, Alicia and the others introduced in The Passage pinpoint the weaknesses of the twelve original vampires . . . even as they confront a betrayal by one of their own.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf43840df6697f860b11aadc806beb2f2d39429c","amp;dn":"Passage+02+-+The+Twelve+-+Justin+Cronin.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf43840df6697f860b11aadc806beb2f2d39429c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,67,132,13,246,105,127,134,11,17,170,220,128,107,235,47,45,57,66,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
