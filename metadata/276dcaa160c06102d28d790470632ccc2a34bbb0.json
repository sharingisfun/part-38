One of the odd things about the band's live set was &quot;In Satan's Name,&quot; a song that was over 10 minutes in length. No Thrash or Death Metal band played songs that long back in the day so, in that sense, False Prophet was a pretty unique act.\n\nIn 1993 the band was forced to change their name to Infernal Hierarchy because an art-Punk band from NY had the name False Prophets. Under their new name they recorded one more 2-song EP, for Rage Records, before splitting up for good.\n\nNow, in 2013, False Prophet is jamming again and time will tell what that may bring.\n\n\n1. \tDiabolic Rites (Intro) \t02:37 \t \n2. \tSecond Death \t12:08 \t \n3. \tHoly Deception \t06:37 \t \n4. \tIn Satan's Name \t10:27 \t \n5. \tForgotten Souls \t04:11 \t \n6. \tBring Back a Memory \t09:23 \t \n7. \tRed Dawn \t02:29 \t \n8. \tSign of the Cross \t03:29 \t \n9. \tDevil's Meat \t02:49 \t \n10. \tFalse Prophecy \t05:44 \t \n11. \tFirst Born \t05:09 \t \n12. \tFalse Prophecy \t05:08 \t \n13. \tMurder or Mercy \t02:18 \t \n14. \tKnights of Salem \t02:30 \t \n  \t01:14:59 \t \nReleased on CD and double vinyl.\n\nDouble vinyl edition released by Blood Harvest.\n\nAll tracks are remastered.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:276dcaa160c06102d28d790470632ccc2a34bbb0","amp;dn":"False+Prophet+-+Second+Death+%28Compilation%29+192k++mp3+ak6103","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"276dcaa160c06102d28d790470632ccc2a34bbb0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,109,202,161,96,192,97,2,210,141,121,4,112,99,44,204,42,52,187,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
