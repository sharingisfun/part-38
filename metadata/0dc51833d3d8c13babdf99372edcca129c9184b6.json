Capricious, in love with beauty, demons are best left to themselves. This is not easy when they can't resist tampering with humans.\n\nJustina Robson's new series is a joyful melding of science fiction and fantasy brought together in the figure of the dangerously lovely Lila Black, a 21-year-old secret agent who's had much of her body replaced with weapon-and-armor-heavy intelligent metal and who isn't sure where her mind ends and her installed AI begins. Lila's world is one where demons, elves, and elementals live alongside people. And somehow Lila and the other agents of the security agency have to provide security for all and stay alive themselves.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0dc51833d3d8c13babdf99372edcca129c9184b6","amp;dn":"Selling+Out++by+Justina+Robson+%5BQauntum+Gravity%5D+%28mobi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0dc51833d3d8c13babdf99372edcca129c9184b6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,197,24,51,211,216,193,59,171,223,153,55,46,220,202,18,156,145,132,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
