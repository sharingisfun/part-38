You'll also learn real-world recording studio techniques like using a microphone effectively, getting the best sounds from your gear, and applying effects like a pro.\n\nBonus! Linked-in audio lets you listen to examples while you read about themÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and, new with this edition, you can follow links to download the project files for the two example songs which demonstrate many of the techniques discussed.
