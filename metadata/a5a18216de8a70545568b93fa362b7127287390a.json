The techniques include highly sensitive immunoassay detection of LDBs, the detection of RohypnolÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® and other LDBs by mass spectrometry, and the ultrasensitive detection of GHB. State-of-the-art and highly practical, Benzodiazepines and GHB: Detection and Pharmacology offers toxicologists, forensic scientists, and clinical chemists today's most effective methods for detecting these widely abused drugs that are sometimes found associated with criminal acts.\n\n\n# Paperback: 160 pages\n# Publisher: Humana Press; Softcover reprint of hardcover 1st ed. 2002 edition (November 19, 2010)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 1617372870\n# ISBN-13: 978-1617372872","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a5a18216de8a70545568b93fa362b7127287390a","amp;dn":"Benzodiazepines+and+GHB-Detection+and+Pharmacology%7BBBS%7D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a5a18216de8a70545568b93fa362b7127287390a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,161,130,22,222,138,112,84,85,104,185,63,163,98,183,18,114,135,57,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
