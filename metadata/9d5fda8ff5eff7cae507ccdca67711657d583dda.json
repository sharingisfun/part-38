Instead of being executed, Lev and Kolya are given a shot at saving their own lives by complying with an outrageous directive: secure a dozen eggs for a powerful Soviet colonel to use in his daughterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wedding cake. In a city cut off from all supplies and suffering unbelievable deprivation, Lev and Kolya embark on a hunt through the dire lawlessness of Leningrad and behind enemy lines to find the impossible.\n\nBy turns insightful and funny, thrilling and terrifying, City of Thieves is a gripping, cinematic World War II adventure and an intimate coming-of-age story with an utterly contemporary feel for how boys become men.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d5fda8ff5eff7cae507ccdca67711657d583dda","amp;dn":"City+of+Thieves+by+David+Bennioff+%28mobi+and+epub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d5fda8ff5eff7cae507ccdca67711657d583dda","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,95,218,143,245,239,247,202,229,7,204,220,166,119,17,101,125,88,61,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
