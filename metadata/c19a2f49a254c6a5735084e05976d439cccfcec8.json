HernÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡n CortÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©s' thirst for gold and power led him to Mexico in 1519, where he launched a conquest unlike any other in history.\n\nAs THE CONQUERORS details, CortÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©s undertook his campaign in violation of explicit instructions; his was supposed to be a more diplomatic than military mission. Yet his first contacts in Mexico resulted in a battle that so terrible that the Aztecs fled into the interior. They had never seen the guns, horses, and shiny metal armor of the conquistadors. In approximately two years, CortÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©s owned the Aztec empire, and their once proud ruler Montezuma was dead. Through brilliant execution, from an often precarious military position, CortÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©s killed hundreds of thousands of Aztecs and brought down the 300-year-old empire-the first major American civilization to fall to the Spanish.\n\nFile Size ------- 330mb\nLength ---------- 45:04\nResolution ------ 720x480\nContainer ------- mkv\nVideo Codec ----- x264\nAudio Codec ----- mp3\nFrame Rate ------ 30\n\np h a t w a r e z . t k\nThanks to (anonymous) for the generous seedbox donation.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c19a2f49a254c6a5735084e05976d439cccfcec8","amp;dn":"History+Channel%3A+Cort%C3%83%C2%A9s+-+Conqueror+of+Mexico","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c19a2f49a254c6a5735084e05976d439cccfcec8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,154,47,73,162,84,198,165,115,80,132,224,89,118,212,57,204,207,206,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
