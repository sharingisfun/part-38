Everything on the pitch looks more realistic; from the stadiums, the playersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ movement, intelligence, and the way the ball moves through the air. Hundreds of new animations to make the game feel more realistic and the whole experience is more televisual by introducing new camera angles and showing the kick-off and final whistle.\n\nTraining\n\nThis year sees a total revamp of team training, with a new simplified overview panel combining general training and match preparation. Choose your weekly team weekly, give the lads a rest after a big win or drag them into training the day after bad performance. You can now even send your coach to acquire more training badges to improve their skills and send the whole squad away on a training camp.\n\nManager Roles\n\nAnother notable difference is the significant restructure of the managerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s staff and a revamp of their roles. The most obvious is the introduced position of Director of Football into the game for the first time, which will allow managers to pass on some of their workload, such as contract negotiations, if they choose to.\n\nIn addition to this, there is an increased number of specialist coaching roles within the game which has given the manager greater flexibility to choose which coaches offer advice and when. The manager can also choose to complain about boardroom interference Ã¢â‚¬â€œ although that particular option should probably be used sparingly.\n\nImproved Network Play\n\nThe brand new Network Play is fully integrated with SteamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s network functionality which means that players should be able to set up and enjoy games against their friends far more easily than before. The Network Mode also allows people to set-up special one-off leagues and cups and to import their team from their career mode, so you can now end any debate about whose FM team is better.\n\nThe deeper integration with Steam will also allow us to manage worldwide leaderboards, so, for the first time youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll really know how good a manager you are.\nFootball Manager Classic\n\nFM13 includes a quicker version of FM called Football Manager Classic. This new mode allow gamers to complete a season in a lot less time than the normal game mode. It retains the 3D match engine and player/staff database, but simplifies the way players manage their club and allows them to focus on selected key areas to build success. A player can complete a season in approximately 7 hours of gameplay.\nChallenges\n\nFootball Manager Classic also includes a number of pre-set challenges users can play.\n\nThe challenges offer players scenarios which is designed to test his or her management skills over a set period of time - usually half a season. The challenges replicate a variety of real world circumstances.\n\nFive challenges were included in the first release:\n\n- The Saviour Cometh - You can't win anything with kids - Injury Crisis - The Invincibles - Top Division Underdog\n\nOn 19th December 2012, two new challenges were added to download from the in-game store.[8]\n\n- Financial Storm - Unrest at Home\n\nFor the first time, FM included a number of unlockable features. Players can remove the need for work permits, add money to their transfer budget or even generate a son within their team's youth system. Players can earn some unlockables by reaching in-game milestones.\nPlayable leagues and club cups\n\nAlthough the following list below is the leagues available immediately from installing the game, the editor allows the players to add any lower level league to existing leagues, as well as the creation of new ones. Thus there are a total of 51 playable nations and 117 playable leagues that are included in the game.\n\nInternational- Club\n\n    World Club Championship\n    Pan-Pacific Championship\n\nInternational- Nations\n\n    World Cup\n    World Cup qualification\n    Olympic Games\n    Olympic Games qualification (Asia, North America, Oceania, South America)\n    UEFA European Football Championship\n    UEFA European Football Championship qualification\n    African Cup of Nations\n    African Cup of Nations qualification\n    AFC Asian Cup\n    AFC Asian Cup qualification\n    CONCACAF Gold Cup\n    Copa AmÃƒÂ©rica\n    OFC Nations Cup\n    Under-20 World Cup\n    AFC Youth Championship\n    AFC Youth Championship qualification\n    UEFA Under 21 Championship\n    UEFA U-21 Championship qualification\n    UEFA U-19 Championship\n    UEFA U-19 Championship qualification\n    South American Youth Championship\n    Nations Cup\n    AFC Challenge Cup\n    AFC Challenge Cup qualification\n    Caribbean Cup\n    FIFA Confederations Cup\n    CONCACAF Under-20 Championship\n    African Youth Championship\n    African Youth Championship qualification\n\nAfrica\n\n    CAF Champions League\n    CAF Confederation Cup\n    CAF Super Cup\n    South Africa South Africa (with National First Division)\n\nAsia and Oceania\n\n    AFC Champions League\n    AFC Cup\n    AFC President's Cup\n    AFF Club Championship\n    A3 Champions Cup\n    OFC Champions League\n    Australia New Zealand A-League (A-League)\n    China China (with First Division)\n    Hong Kong Hong Kong\n    India India\n    Indonesia Indonesia (with Liga Premier Division and First Division)\n    Malaysia Malaysia (with Malaysian Premier League)\n    Singapore Singapore\n    South Korea South Korea (with N-League)\n\nUK &amp; Ireland\n\n    Setanta Sports Cup\n    England England (with Championship, League One, League Two, Conference National, Conference North, Conference South)\n    Northern Ireland Northern Ireland (with IFA Championship 1 and IFA Championship 2)\n    Republic of Ireland Republic of Ireland (with First Division)\n    Scotland Scotland (with First Division, Second Division, Third Division)\n    Wales Wales\n\n\n\n* enjoy ...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:21dbf9bbc85c2ebe869a1b07b3f92b79b65fee1e","amp;dn":"Football+Manager+2013+-+Multi12+Portable+GLOBE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"21dbf9bbc85c2ebe869a1b07b3f92b79b65fee1e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,219,249,187,200,92,46,190,134,154,27,7,179,249,43,121,182,95,238,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
