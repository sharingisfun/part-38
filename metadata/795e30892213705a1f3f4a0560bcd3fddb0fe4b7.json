The organic evolution and spontaneity of the performances suggests they were improvised in the studio, with James Brown barking orders and directing traffic more than he sings, at least in any conventional sense; the band follows his directions with the blind faith and respect of soldiers following a veteran general into battle, time and again summoning even greater intensity to ratchet the music to another level. Not quite yet funk, It's a Mother is nevertheless beyond soul music altogether--another brand new bag to bide the time until the next one comes along. \r\n\r\n01 - Mother Popcorn (Part 1)\r\n02 - Mother Popcorn (Part 2)\r\n03 - Mashed Potato Popcorn (Part 1)\r\n04 - Mashed Potato Popcorn (Part 2)\r\n05 - I'm Shook\r\n06 - Popcorn With A Feeling (Instrumental)\r\n07 - The Little Groove Maker Me (Pts 1 &amp; 2)\r\n08 - Any Day Now\r\n09 - If I Ruled The World\r\n10 - You're Still Out Of Sight\r\n11 - Top Of The Stack (Instrumental)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:795e30892213705a1f3f4a0560bcd3fddb0fe4b7","amp;dn":"James+Brown+-+It%27s+A+Mother+%281969%29+%5B2012+WEB+flac%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"795e30892213705a1f3f4a0560bcd3fddb0fe4b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,94,48,137,34,19,112,90,31,63,74,5,96,188,211,253,219,15,228,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
