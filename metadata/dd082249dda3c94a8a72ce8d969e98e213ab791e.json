Do you have trouble achieving that wonderful, chewy-crunchy crust that you get at a pizzeria? Have you made good pizza, but find that you are unable to do it consistently? Have you looked at pizza cookbooks and baking stones in the store, but did not have the guts to try making pizza, yourself? Worse yet, do you have a pizza pan or a pizza stone that is sitting in your cupboard gathering dust because you have never made a pizza that is good enough to justify all the effort. Passionate About Pizza: Making Great Homemade Pizza is what you need!\nThink of the best pizza you ever had. Do you wish that you could have that pizza again, maybe even all the time?
