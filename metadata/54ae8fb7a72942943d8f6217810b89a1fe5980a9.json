I decided to repost this as it was hard to find a sims 2 game without any expansion included\n\nOriginally Posted by Chriss2525 from Demonoid.\n\nAll the instructions are included. This is a working file, very easy to install, see for your self.\n\n\nPlease seed and comment :)\n\nFOR SOME PEOPLE THE CRACK IS NOT WORKING SKIP THAT AND JUST RUN CD1!!!\n\n1. Mount disc 1. start installing the game and input the serial key.(You will find the serial in the &quot;How to install folder&quot;)\n\n2. When it asks for disk 2 unmount Disk 1 and Mount disk 2.\n\n3. Same again.\n\n4. Same again.\n\n5. As the crack was causing problems i suggest that you DO NOT! install it.\n\n6. When you click the desktop shortcut to play the game it will ask for you to insert disk 1 so unmount disk 4(if you still have it mounted) and mount disk 1. The game will think you have an actuall disk and boot up as normal.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:54ae8fb7a72942943d8f6217810b89a1fe5980a9","amp;dn":"Sims+2+game+only","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"54ae8fb7a72942943d8f6217810b89a1fe5980a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,174,143,183,167,41,66,148,61,143,98,23,129,11,137,161,254,89,128,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
