Since its inception, OOTP has won numerous awards, including multiple &quot;Sports Game of the Year&quot; awards, en route to becoming the most immersive, realistic, and customizable baseball experience a fan can ask for!\n\nInstructions: This is just a basic patch. Install OOTP 14.5.28 as normal. Open the patch as admin. Click the &quot;Browse For Exe&quot; button and select ootp14.exe from the installation folder. Tick the &quot;Make Backup&quot; box if you want to make a backup of the original exe. Click the &quot;Crack Game&quot; button. Open the game and register with any serial. The number &quot;1&quot; without quotes works for sure. That is it. Enjoy!\n\nNotes: I decided to switch to a .NET based C# patch. No VB6 runtime files any longer and I imagine at this point that everyone has the .NET framework. Please leave a quick comment letting me know if you like this style better than the old one and if it worked for you or not. Enjoy the game.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:528b663f2be48cde14071e832d9d285dffef18f4","amp;dn":"Out+Of+The+Park+Baseball+14.5.28+%28Update+5%29+Patch++-+SoN","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"528b663f2be48cde14071e832d9d285dffef18f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,139,102,63,43,228,140,222,20,7,30,131,45,157,40,93,255,239,24,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
