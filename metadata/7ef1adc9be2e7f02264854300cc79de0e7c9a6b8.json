But when an Elven girl fell hopelessly in love with a Darkling boy of the Void, he carried away more than her heart.\n \nThousands of years later, tumultuous times are upon the world now known as the Four Lands. Users of magic are in conflict with proponents of science. Elves have distanced their society from the other races. The dwindling Druid order and its teachings are threatened with extinction. A sinister politician has used treachery and murder to rise as prime minister of the mighty Federation. Meanwhile, poring through a long-forgotten diary, the young Druid Aphenglow Elessedil has stumbled upon the secret account of an Elven girlÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s heartbreak and the shocking truth about the vanished Elfstones. But never has a little knowledge been so very dangerousÃ¢â‚¬â€as Aphenglow quickly learns when sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s set upon by assassins.\n\n\n                              Format 1 - Epub\n\n                              Format 2 - Mobi","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ef1adc9be2e7f02264854300cc79de0e7c9a6b8","amp;dn":"Wards+of+Faerie+by+Terry+Brooks+%28The+Dark+Legacy+of+Shannara+Boo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ef1adc9be2e7f02264854300cc79de0e7c9a6b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,241,173,201,190,46,127,2,38,72,84,48,12,199,157,224,231,201,166,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
