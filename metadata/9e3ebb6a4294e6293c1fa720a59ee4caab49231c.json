Numb from watching too much TV and trading snipes with his mother, Philip is in stasis. But everything changes one winter night when Ronnie's high school girlfriend shows up on their doorstep to deliver the news that she is pregnant ... and the father, she claims, is Ronnie.\n\nSo begins the startling tale as Philip and his mother confront Melissa's past and their own. Their search for answers takes them on an emotional journey, placing them in the path of murder and revenge. At once a moving story of redemption and a heart-stopping work of suspense, Strange but True brings to life a cast of characters that no reader will soon forget.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e3ebb6a4294e6293c1fa720a59ee4caab49231c","amp;dn":"Strange+but+True+-+John+Searles.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e3ebb6a4294e6293c1fa720a59ee4caab49231c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,62,187,106,66,148,230,41,60,31,167,32,165,158,228,202,171,73,35,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
