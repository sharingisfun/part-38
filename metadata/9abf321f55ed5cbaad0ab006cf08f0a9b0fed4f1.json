First hailed as a great advance in science, Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Limits to GrowthÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ was subsequently rejected and demonized. However, with many national economies now at risk and global peak oil apparently a reality, the methods, scenarios, and predictions of Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Limits to GrowthÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ are in great need of reappraisal. In The Limits to Growth Revisited, Ugo Bardi examines both the science and the polemics surrounding this work, and in particular the reactions of economists that marginalized its methods and conclusions for more than 30 years. Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Limits to GrowthÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ was a milestone in attempts to model the future of our society, and it is vital today for both scientists and policy makers to understand its scientific basis, current relevance, and the social and political mechanisms that led to its rejection. Bardi also addresses the all-important question of whether the methods and approaches of Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Limits to GrowthÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ can contribute  to an understanding of what happened to the global economy in the Great Recession and where we are headed from there.\n\n136 pages\nSeries: SpringerBriefs in Energy / Energy Analysis\nPublisher: Springer; 2011 edition (June 9, 2011)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1441994157\nISBN-13: 978-1441994158","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9abf321f55ed5cbaad0ab006cf08f0a9b0fed4f1","amp;dn":"The+Limits+to+Growth+Revisited+%282011%29+by+Ugo+Bardi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9abf321f55ed5cbaad0ab006cf08f0a9b0fed4f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,191,50,31,85,237,92,186,173,10,176,6,207,8,240,169,176,254,212,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
