Marvel had previously used the name for a Western character whose name was later changed to Night Rider and subsequently to Phantom Rider.\n\nThe second volume of the Supernatural Ghost Rider series (1990-98) featured Daniel Ketch as a new Ghost Rider. After his sister was injured by ninja gangsters, Ketch came in contact with a motorcycle which had somehow been mystically enchanted to contain the essence of a &quot;Spirit of Vengeance.&quot; This spirit had originally been a Puritan man named Noble Kale, an ancestor of both Blaze and Ketch. Johnny Blaze reappeared in this series as a supporting character and was revealed to be Ketch&amp;#039;s brother.\n\nThanks to the scanners and the varied original sources.\n\nPlease seed. Please enjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc16ab54dc3231e2623247cba1bd0cc1ebfd7cc6","amp;dn":"Ghost+Rider+v2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc16ab54dc3231e2623247cba1bd0cc1ebfd7cc6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,22,171,84,220,50,49,226,98,50,71,203,161,189,12,193,235,253,124,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
