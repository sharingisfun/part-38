Whispers abound of a monster that lurks in the darkness as more and more of the city's residents go missing.

Following a narrow escape, Emma discovers that she is the only one who has any chance to stop him.\n\nOn her way to an impossible confrontation, Emma will learn that the crisis is greater than it seems, and that at stake are the fates of those she cares about the most, and that of the entire world.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d53b7ee14c729dbb8b2690e8a0b970afa3e52d43","amp;dn":"Emma+and+the+Minotaur","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d53b7ee14c729dbb8b2690e8a0b970afa3e52d43","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,59,126,225,76,114,157,187,139,38,144,232,160,185,112,175,163,229,45,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
