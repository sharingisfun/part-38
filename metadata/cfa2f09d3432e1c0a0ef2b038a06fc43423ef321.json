With no job possibilities on the horizon, the two dads open their own day care facility, &quot;Daddy Day Care&quot;, and employ some fairly unconventional and sidesplitting methods of caring for children. As &quot;Daddy Day Care&quot; starts to catch on, it launches them into a highly comedic rivalry with Chapman Academy's tough-as-nails director... who has driven all previous competitors out of business.\n\nImdb:       &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0317303/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0317303/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n             Users: (16,890 votes) 107 reviews | Critics: 81 reviews \n\n             Imdb:5.4/10\n\nRuntime:     92 min\n\nYear:        2003\n\nGengre:      Comedy | Family \n\nScource:     Dvd| Retail |Pal\n\nRars:        No\n\nSubs:        Swedish\n             Norwegian\n             Danish\n             Finish      \n             Icelandic\n\nAudio:       English (Dolby Digital 5.1)\n             Finish (Dolby Surround)\n             Swedish (Dolby Digital 5.1)\n\nImage:       Widescreen 1.85:1 (anamorfisk) \n              \nExtras:      Yes\n\nFormat:      Iso\n\nMenu:        Yes\n\nStripped     No\n\nDirector:    Steve Carr\n\nWriter:      Geoff Rodkey\n\nStars:       Eddie Murphy\n             Jeff Garlin\n             Anjelica Huston\n\n\n\n                      \n                     \n                      ENJOY COMMENT &amp; SEED!
