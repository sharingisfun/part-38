The sessions were rough going \nfrom the beginning. First, their manager, Peter Grant, withdrew from view after the \ndeath of Led Zeppelin drummer, John Bonham in 1980. That same year, the murder of John \nLennon made the band change their way of thinking. Then, on another occasion, a fistfight \nbroke out between Paul Rodgers and Boz Burrell, only to be restrained by Mick Ralphs and \nSimon Kirke.\n\nThe album's opening track, &quot;Electricland&quot;, written by Rodgers, was the album's biggest hit. \nRodgers' &quot;Painted Face&quot; also received substantial airplay on rock stations.\n\nThe album became the original lineup's worst selling album, reaching a disappointing \n#26 on the Billboard album charts in 1982.\n\n   1.
