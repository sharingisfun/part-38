I had to go off the grid and into the deep web to bring this to you, but it needed to be done. This media has now been liberated from those in control of the system, spread it far and wide.\n\nI have no affiliation with PPMTV (ppmtvnh.org) or Dorks in Dungeons (dorksindungeons.com); I'm just a concerned citizen who thinks the public has a right to know what kind of things are going on behind closed doors. Shout it from the rooftops, THE ROBIN FOWLER SHOW SHOULD BE FREE AND AVAILABLE TO ALL!\n\nDorks in Dungeons LIVE!\nSeacoast Repertory Theatre\n4/13 7pm\n5/18 7pm\n6/22 7pm\n\nTix ahead of time at seacoastrep.org or PAY WHAT YOU CAN at the door.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6573d8c2effca7dca1cf26ba7eb11002914c3a8f","amp;dn":"The+Robin+Fowler+Show+101+LEAK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6573d8c2effca7dca1cf26ba7eb11002914c3a8f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,115,216,194,239,252,167,220,161,207,38,186,126,177,16,2,145,76,58,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
