From their stunning introduction\nduring the Isle Of Wight Festival in 1970, the trio became a by-word for\nvirtuoso musicianship and the over-the-top extravagances associated\nwith Rock ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“NÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Roll during the 70's.Never afraid to tear-up and re-write the\nrule book on how popular music could be consumed and presented, Keith\nEmerson (keyboards), Greg Lake (bass &amp; vocals) and Carl Palmer\n(drums &amp; percussion) took many risks as both studio recording artists\nand on-stage performers. Their marrying of neo-classical works to Heavy\nRock with dazzling special effects under arena conditions was a\npresentation which had to be experienced at first-hand to be truly\nbelieved!Releasing a succession of multi-award winning albums, ELP\nfinally called a halt to their initial career in 1978 though later reformed for\ntwo years and as many more albums.Recently rumours have been rife\nconcerning a 40th anniversary reformation for 2010 and a chance once\nmore for the common man to celebrate the works of Messrs Emerson,\nLake &amp; Palmer.Released in August 1974, Welcome Back My Friends To\nThe Show That Never Ends...Ladies And Gentlemen, Emerson Lake &amp;\nPalmer, the triple live album that chronicled ELPÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s successful 1973/74\nworld tour made rock history. It was the first, and only, triple live album by\na rock band to hit the Top 5 and become a platinum seller.Only six triple\nalbums have made it into the Top 10 in history, with the two most popular\nbeing the soundtrack from the film, Woodstock, and ex-Beatle George\nHarrisonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s All Things Must Pass. The fact that ELPÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s album, which was a\nlive album and not a new studio release, made it to #4 remains an\nastonishing feat.Despite its wordy title, the album was designed to be a\nshowcase of the bands raw talent, along with being testament of its\nblistering live show, which had become the most exciting concert\nexperience of its time, hands down. Although taken from multiple nights\nthat that band performed in February 1974 at the Anaheim Convention\nCenter near Los Angeles, the original triple LP set featured the show the\nband played on the tour promoting Brain Salad Surgery (the same show\nwould be seen by 70 million on ABC-TV in the USAlater that Spring when\nELP headlined the legendary California Jam before 250,000 enthusiastic\nmusic fans).\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n   1.
