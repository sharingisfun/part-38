The event is framed by the story of a woman in the process of creating a computer program about the tragic event in which Japanese soldiers and officers killed their own families and then themselves en masse in hopes of frightening the American troops with the shock of it all. Unfortunately, the horrific gambit failed; the Americans misunderstood and this made it easier for them to justify using the bomb.\n-AMG Review\n\nThe quality is quite bad but this is ultra-rare and there is no DVD or other rip available.\n\n\n********************************* FREAKYFLICKS **********************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing\ncinematic art in the digital era.
