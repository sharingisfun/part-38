Johnson composed scores for a handful of films and released a solo album as EDJ before re-embracing his more well-known moniker.\r\nOn Fruit Batsâ€™ sixth LP, Absolute Loser, he continues to operate as a band of one, at least in terms of official membership, though the record carries a jangle-rich, full-band presence. Johnson also re-embraces his groupâ€™s folky roots, as demonstrated by the banjo that ornaments â€œHumbug Mountain Song,â€ an uptempo, minor-key remembrance. That quality is also reflected in titles like â€œFrom a Soon-to-Be Ghost Town,â€ an easygoing alt-country elegy (â€œYou know itâ€™s hard to be the last one in a soon-to-be ghost town/When all that youâ€™ve loved is now goneâ€). The likewise geographical â€œMy Sweet Midwestâ€ is a warm and lively anthem that would make a fine jingle for a visitorâ€™s bureau somewhere with amber waves of grain, if taken literally instead of metaphorically. Elsewhere, twang seasons pretty chords on the lush, synth-enforced â€œNone of Us.â€ The trippier â€œGood Will Come to Youâ€ gets hazy in the chorus with its wash of electronic and acoustic textures, and â€œDonâ€™t You Know Thatâ€ studies the relentlessness of the new day in the face of loss with sparse piano, acoustic guitar, and elegant solo electric guitar.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, Absolute Loser is dominated by an energetic wistfulness and sweet melodicism that characterize most of Johnsonâ€™s work, whatever his instrument palette. While that should please fans, the solidly crafted song set also offers as good an entry point as any for potential admirers.\r\n\r\nTracklist:\r\n01 - From a Soon-to-Be Ghost Town.flac\r\n02 - Humbug Mountain Song.flac\r\n03 - None of Us.flac\r\n04 - Absolute Loser.flac\r\n05 - Baby Bluebird.flac\r\n06 - My Sweet Midwest.flac\r\n07 - Birthday Drunk.flac\r\n08 - Good Will Come to You.flac\r\n09 - It Must Be Easy.flac\r\n10 - Don't You Know That.flac\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nCountry: USA\r\nGenre: Indie-Folk\r\n\r\n\r\nMedia Report:\r\nSource : CD\r\nFormat : FLAC\r\nFormat/Info : Free Lossless Audio Codec, 16-bit PCM\r\nBit rate mode : Variable\r\nBit rate : ~692-947 Kbps\r\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\r\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\r\nBit depth : 16 bits","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:268e55ff98a0a497de24eb3a7617204af4f7c747","amp;dn":"%282016%29+Fruit+Bats+-+Absolute+Loser+%5BFLAC%2CTracks%5D+%7B100.XY%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"268e55ff98a0a497de24eb3a7617204af4f7c747","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,142,85,255,152,160,164,151,222,36,235,58,118,23,32,74,244,247,199,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
