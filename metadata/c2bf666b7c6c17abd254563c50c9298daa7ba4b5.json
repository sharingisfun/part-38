To most R&amp;B fans, the album will come off as too saccharine-sweet, but to fans of teen pop the album is a godsend. The 14-year-old chanteuse brings a much-needed dose of hip-hop to the teen pop genre and her debut album, Mikaila, has energy that's rarely matched by other teen performers like Christina Aguilera and Britney Spears. The hip-hop influence is felt strongest on &quot;Talkin' Bout Me,&quot; a track produced by Dru Hill member Nokio. Unfortunately, the album includes too many obligatory ballads such as &quot;Forever, For Always, for You&quot; and catchy dance tunes like &quot;So in Love With You.&quot; At just 14, Makaila shows some skills and given some time to mature, she could turn into a credible R&amp;B performer. Until then, Mikaila should stick to the teen market and hope that her audience will grow up with her.\n\nTrack Listing:\n\n01. So In Love With Two (03:27), 6.35 MB\n02.
