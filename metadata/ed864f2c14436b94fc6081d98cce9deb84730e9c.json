Thoroughly evaluated by independent reviewers, each chapter focuses on a particular algorithm and is written by either the original authors of the algorithm or world-class researchers who have extensively studied the respective algorithm. The book concentrates on the following important algorithms: C4.5, k-Means, SVM, Apriori, EM, PageRank, AdaBoost, kNN, Naive Bayes, and CART.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed864f2c14436b94fc6081d98cce9deb84730e9c","amp;dn":"The+Top+Ten+Algorithms+in+Data+Mining","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed864f2c14436b94fc6081d98cce9deb84730e9c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,134,79,44,20,67,107,148,252,96,129,217,140,206,157,235,132,115,14,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
