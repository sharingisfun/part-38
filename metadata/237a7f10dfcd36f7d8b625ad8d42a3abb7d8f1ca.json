MSX begun producing in 1983 year, MSX-2 in 1985 year. Many big companies (http://www.passionmsx.org/msxgamesbox/museum/index.php) produced their models of this computer: Sony, Panasonic, Toshiba, Philips, etc. These computers were popular in Japan, South Korea, Brazil, Netherlands, Spain, France, USSR, but almost not known in USA. More than 1500 games were made for it, but many of them have no English language versions. From 1988 year 8-bit computers and MSX specifically loose interest to them, being exceled by 16-bit computer systems becoming cheaper. There were sold about 5 million MSX in the world, quantity comparable to Apple II and Atari ST, and more then Amstrad CPC.\n\n=Technical specifications=\n\nMSX-1 (1983 Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â³.): CPU Zilog Z80A 3.58 MHz; RAM to 64 KB; videochip TI TMS9918, 16 KB, 256x192x16 colors (palette 16 colors), hardware 1-color sprites; 40x24 text; soundchip AY-3-8910, 3 channels + noise; ROM with BASIC; cartridge slot for programs and expansions.\n\nMSX-2 (1985 Ãƒï¿½Ã‚Â³.), difference from MSX-1: RAM 64-128 KB (in common); videochip Yamaha V9938, 128 KB, 512x212x16 colors, 256x212x256 colors (palette 512 colors, no influence to near pixels; 256 colors mode was not used in games, in common), hardware 16-color sprites; 80x24 text; clock chip; 100% hardware compatibility with MSX-1; ordinary, had a built-in 720 KB floppy drive. As an addition many users installed MSX-MUSIC cartridge expansion. MSX-2 have the best graphics capabilities among 8-bit home computers (among 8-bit platforms Sega Master System is close).\n\nSome games were ported from ZX Spectrum to MSX-1 and look the same ugly as at Spectrum. Games that were specially developed for MSX-1 and especially MSX-2 look with a noticable difference.\n\nTo know more about this platform and how to use emulators you may read the FAQ (http://www.faq.msxnet.org)\n\n\n=The compilation includes=\n\nFunet (ftp://ftp.funet.fi, http://www.msxarchive.nl) - documents, photos, games, programs, etc.\nMRC (http://www.msx.org) - news, music, demos, programs, etc.\nPassion MSX (http://www.passionmsx.org) - news, demos, music, games, programs, games translations, etc.\nMSX Info (http://msx.retro8bits.com) - documents, programs\nMsxIsland (http://www.msxisland.com) - games, documents, programs, music, demos, etc.\nXtory MSX (http://members.fortunecity.com/2ndf1/msx-eng.htm) - games, programs, etc.\nMSX TOSEC (http://www.tosecdev.org) - games, diskmagazines, bioses\nGamebase MSX (http://www.gb64.com) - games with screenshots\nMCCM Millennium- games, programs\nMSX-Mbox (http://www.msx#posse.com) - games with screenshots\nMSX No-Intro (http://datomatic.no-intro.org) - games\nGoodMSX (http://www.allgoodthings.us/mambo/) - games\nMsxSolutions (http://msxsolutions.msxblue.com) - games maps\nNeonnights (http://neonnights.msxblue.com) - games maps\nMSX IPS Patch Archive (http://ips.tni.nl) - patches for .roms wich add translation to games\nGeneration MSX (http://www.generation-msx.nl) - games info and screenshots\nOfflineList MSX (http://offlinelist.free.fr) - games info, some with screenshots\nUltimate MSX FAQ (http://www.faq.msxnet.org) - FAQ about MSX\nKomkon (http://fms.komkon.org/MSX/, ftp://ftp.komkon.org) - programs, games, documents\nMsxPro (http://www.msxpro.com) - documents, programs\nMSX Assembly (http://map.tni.nl) - documents, sources\nBifi (http://bifi.msxnet.org/msxnet/, ftp://ftp.bifi.msxnet.org) - documents, programs\nAdrianpage (http://www.alsoftware.com.br/adrianpage/) - programs\nNyyrikki (http://msx.fi/nyyrikki/) - programs\nMsx Banzai (http://msxbanzai.tni.nl) - news, programs\nLieves!Tuore (http://www.kameli.net/lt/) - site of demo-group Lieves!Tuore\nBandwagon (http://gr.ath_cx/bandwagon) - site of demo-group Bandwagon\nTeam Bomba (http://www.teambomba.net) - site of demo-group Team Bomba\nAbyssmsx (http://www.abyssmsx.com) - programs, demos\nAmusement Factory (http://www.caetano.eng.br/main/) - programs\nAvelino Morales Page (http://msx.atlantes.org/index_en.html) - sources\nFRS (http://frs.badcoffee.info) - games adopted for hard disk\nJJC Software (http://www.dlcsistemas.com/msx/) - programs, documents\nMSX Files (http://www.icongames.com.br/msxfiles/main.htm) - programs, games\nVincent van Dam (http://home.kabelfoon.nl/~vincentd/) - programs\nMSX forever (http://www.yspu.yar.ru/MSX/) - programs, games\nHomepage by cax (http://cax.nm.ru) - programs\nMSX Page by Secoh (http://www.secoh.ru/msx/) - sources\nPC Remakes (http://computeremuzone.com/remakes/) - remakes of MSX games\nMSX Music - chiptune music\nRevistas MSX en espanol (http://personales.ya.com/robpermil/) - index of games in Spanish magazines\nMSX Magazines (http://www.abandonware-magazines.org, etc.) - magazines about MSX\nMSX Books (http://msxlivros.blogspot_com, etc.) - books about MSX\nMSX Video - video about MSX\nEmulators - emulators\nAlmost MSX - stuff for computers similar to MSX (same CPU and video)\nDifferent - simply different\n\n\n!!!
