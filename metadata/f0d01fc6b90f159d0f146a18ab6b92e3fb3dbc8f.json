They were \nunashamedly pop, to the point of padding the front of their trousers for \ntelevision appearances. At the heart, however, was a string of catchy singalong \nsingles written by George Michael (born Georgios Kyrriacos Panayiotou in London \nto a Greek restauranting family).\n\nGeorge met Wham!'s other half, Andrew Ridgeley, at school in the London suburb \nof Bushey, and in 1979 they started performing together as part of the ska-based \nband the Executive. When that group dissolved, they wrote songs, made demos, and \nrushed into a recording contract with the equally eager independent label \nInnervision, scoring an instant hit with &quot;Wham Rap!&quot; (they thought that &quot;wham&quot; \nwas the sound they made when Michael and Ridgeley performed together). In order \nto move to a recording contract with Sony label Epic, Wham! was forced to walk \naway from most of the royalties from their debut album, Fantastic. None of that \nmattered when their 1984 single, &quot;Wake Me up Before You Go Go,&quot; became a \nworldwide hit, accompanied by a video of the pair cavorting in their sportswear. \nAlmost immediately, George Michael started thinking of a solo career, and \nreleased &quot;Careless Whisper,&quot; issued in the U.S. under George Michael of Wham!\n\nWham!'s end came suddenly two years later, in 1985, reputedly when the group's \nmanager, Simon Napier-Bell (later to manage Take That), decided to sell a share \nof his management to a South African entertainment conglomerate. Supposedly, as \npart of a stand against South African politics, George Michael immediately \nannounced Wham!'s breakup. They gave their farewell performance before a sold-\nout audience of 72,000 fans at London's Wembley Stadium.\n\nGeorge Michael comfortably stepped straight into his own highly successful solo \nperforming and recording career. Andrew Ridgeley's post Wham! album, Son of \nAlbert, sold poorly and produced just one minor hit, &quot;Shake.&quot; \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAlbum Review by William Cooper\n\nFantastic is the misguided 1983 debut release from the U.K. duo Wham. With \nFantastic, George Michael and partner Andrew Ridgeley introduced themselves as \nleather jacket-clad, street-smart &quot;rebels.&quot; This approach proved wildly popular \nin the U.K., where Fantastic was a Top Ten hit, but the album went largely \nunnoticed in the States. While Fantastic showcases the ability of the young (20 \nat the time of the album's release) George Michael to craft engaging, hook-\nfilled melodies, much of the material on Fantastic suffers from the duo's \npretentious, tough-guy posturing. The empty funk of the U.K. hits &quot;Bad Boys,&quot; \n&quot;Young Guns (Go for It),&quot; and the embarrassing &quot;Wham Rap&quot; barely registers, and \nMichael's smart-aleck, self-conscious lyrics are often unintentionally \nhilarious. Although Michael eventually became well-known as a reasonably \nsuccessful emulator of R&amp;B trends, neither these tunes nor Fantastic's \nstupefying remake of the Miracles' &quot;Love Machine&quot; give any indication of his \nabilities. At best, Fantastic can be viewed as a testament to George Michael's \nmaturity. &quot;Nothing Looks the Same in the Light&quot; and &quot;Club Tropicana,&quot; two of \nFantastic's best tunes, lean toward the lush, adult pop of Michael's later solo \nwork. Fortunately, Michael and Ridgeley would later ditch the superficial, \nleather-jacketed approach for the more sophisticated pop of later Wham releases \nlike &quot;Everything She Wants&quot; and &quot;Freedom&quot; (both from 1984's Make It Big) and \n&quot;The Edge of Heaven&quot; (from 1986's Music From the Edge of Heaven), finding major \nU.S. success in the process. Fantastic isn't a good album, but it's oddly \nentertaining. It's certainly interesting hearing the difference between the \nfrothy Fantastic and Michael's later, &quot;serious&quot; solo work like Listen Without \nPrejudice and Older. And Fantastic is also good for a few chuckles. \nUnfortunately, that probably wasn't George Michael's intention. But even he \nmight get a good laugh out of it. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBAD BOYS\n\nSong Review by Amy Hanson\n\nThe duoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s third, and most popular single yet when it dropped in at #2 on the \nBritish chart in May 1983, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½Bad BoysÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ was an easy, breezy winner all around, \neven if it remained somewhat musically indebted to its predecessor, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½Young Guns \n(Go For ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. Toning down the political rhetoric, yet still espousing a less than \npure invitation to the party life, the song rang out to the disenfranchised, \ninviting bad boys all across the land to step out of the oppressive family unit \nfor sex, smokes, fast cars and even faster girls. With backing singers Pepsi &amp; \nShirley trilling out the chorus, and an irresistible battery of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œwhooo whooosÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ \nthrown in for maddening emphasis, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½Bad BoysÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ was further dignified by a charming \nvideo that placed both Michael and Ridgeley in the short pants and satchel set, \nbefore pouring them into the tight pants and studded leather that was more in \nkeeping with their at-the-time sex star images. Musically and visually, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a \nsmart, funny look at youth gone normally wrong. \n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nExact Audio Copy V0.99 prebeta 4 from 23.
