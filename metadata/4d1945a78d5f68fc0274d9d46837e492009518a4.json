Bauhaus just recently stopped as a band and Peter Murphy was all alone. The father of Goth music surprised everyone by joining former Japan member Mick Karn and forming a band called Dalis Car. When everyone expected a continuing sound of Bauhaus this was a bit of a shocker. Only one record was made plus a single. The way they made the record is probably unique. They never spent a single moment together in a studio or anywhere else while writing and making the songs. Instead they sent tapes to eachother and when they where both happy with one song that was it. \n\nBonus includes the full single together with B-sides.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d1945a78d5f68fc0274d9d46837e492009518a4","amp;dn":"Dalis+Car","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d1945a78d5f68fc0274d9d46837e492009518a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,25,69,167,141,95,104,252,2,116,217,212,104,55,228,146,0,149,24,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
