I guess you all should like him?\n- Hector who???\nBut eagle and my brother said: - Trust your wife.\nAnd so we started chasing... and it was really worth the effort...\nZazou was a peculiar artist who explored the music scene in a very personal way... From his progressive &quot;Erik Satie&quot; beginnings with ZNR to electronic music, mixed with avantgarde and especially world music of whatever kind: african, asian until sacred celtic music.\nHe worked with many artists, known and unknown: Bill Laswell, Brendan Parry, David Sylvian, Harold Budd and also Bony Bikaye, Carlos NÃƒÂºÃƒÂ±ez, Sainkho Namtchylak - just to cite some of them (and I guess the last three will be unknown to many of you :) )\nSurely a torrent not for MTV consumers... but my mates and me are stubborn... we believe in music... \nThere are 27 album and a DVD (from Quadri + Chromies: a loopable visual installation, worth a Venice Biennal, with the artwork of Bernard Caillaud with the music tapestries of Zazou).\nAll the album are zipped (since the number of files was too high for TPB). The sampling rate is 320kbps when possible. Different rates are signed in the name of the albums zips. Enjoy :)\n\n             &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.h33t.com:3310/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.h33t.com:3310/announce&lt;/a&gt;\n\nudp://tracker.openbittorrent.com:80/announce\n\nudp://tracker.istole.it:6969\n\nudp://tracker.publicbt.com:80/announce\n\nudp://open.demonii.com:1337\n\n____________\n\n\nAlbum list:\n\nSolo\n1979 - La Perversita - 192\n1985 - Geographies\n1986 - Reivax Au Bongo\n1989 - Geologies\n1991 - Les Nouvelles Polyphonies Corses\n1992 - Sahara Blue\n1994 - Song from the cold seas\n1998 - Lights In The Dark\n2004 - L'Absence\n2006 - Quadri _ Chromies\n2006 - Quadri _ Chromies _ DVD\n2007 - Merle Noir - VBR\n\nwith Barbara Gogan\n1997 - Made On Earth\n\nwith Bony Bikaye\n1983 - and CY1 - Noir Et Blanc\n1988 - Guilty\n\nwith Carlos NÃƒÂºÃƒÂ±ez\n1999 - Os amores libres\n\nwith Eramo and Saletti\n2010 - Oriental Night Fever - VBR\n\nwith Harold Budd\n1995 - Glyph\n\nwith Katie Jane Garside\n2008 - Corps Electriques \n\nwith Laurence Revey\n1999 - Le creux des fees - 192\n\nwith P.G.R\n2002 - Per Grazia Ricevuta - 192\n\nwith Penta Leslee Swanson\n1994 - Sorrow And Solitude\n\nwith Sainkho Namtchylak\t\n1993 - Out of Tuva\n\nwith Sandy Dillon\n2000 - Las Vegas Is Cursed\n\nwith Sevara Nazarkhan\n2003 - Yol Bolsin\n\nwith Swara\n2008 - In The House Of Mirrors\n\nwith various artists\n2003 - Twelve Extraordinary Women - Strong Currents\n\nwith ZNR\n1977 - Barricade 3\n1978 - TraitÃƒÂ© De MÃƒÂ©canique Populaire - 192\n\n\n(browse all my torrents:\n     \n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/user/n0b0dyh0me/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/user/n0b0dyh0me/&lt;/a&gt; \n\n\n)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:270f44a9943cac649242158c3bdbc3af51119d0f","amp;dn":"Hector+Zazou+discography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"270f44a9943cac649242158c3bdbc3af51119d0f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,15,68,169,148,60,172,100,146,66,21,140,59,219,195,175,81,17,157,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
