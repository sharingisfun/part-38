Love them love them love them. Mildly disappointed that they&amp;#039;re not playing Lollapalooza this year, but love them anyway.\n\nI uploaded the same torrent (but 160KBPS) a while back, but I re-copied all my cd&amp;#039;s to mp3&amp;#039;s and made them 192kbps, so now I can no longer the original torrent I uploaded.  Hopefully there are others out there that are doing so.\n\nAnyhoo, I&amp;#039;m re-seeding Girls Can Tell, as well as kill the Moonlight.\n\nI hope this works.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa361f658bfd1d64818c120e249a3fecc679c30a","amp;dn":"Spoon-Girls+Can+Tell%282000%29%5BMP3+192kbps%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa361f658bfd1d64818c120e249a3fecc679c30a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,54,31,101,139,253,29,100,129,140,18,14,36,154,63,236,198,121,195,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
