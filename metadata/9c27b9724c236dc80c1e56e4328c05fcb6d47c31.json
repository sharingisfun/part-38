The chapters in each\npart lay out the specific details of that partÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s topic. Each chapter and part\nis written so you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have to read what came before or after, though I\nsometimes refer you to other areas for more information. HereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a brief\nlook at the parts.\nPart I: Introducing Florida\nThink of this part as the hors dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢oeuvre. In this part, I tempt you with the\nbest experiences, hotels, eateries, and attractions in Florida. I throw in a\nweather forecast, look at special events, and then help you plan a budget.\nI also provide special tips for families, seniors, travelers with disabilities,\nand gay and lesbian travelers.\nPart II: Planning Your Trip to Florida\nShould you use a travel agent?

In this part, I answer those questions and\nalso talk about the advantages Ã¢â‚¬â€ and disadvantages Ã¢â‚¬â€ of booking your\ntrip on the Internet as well as list some good online resources. In addition,\nI get into money matters, discussing whether youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re better off using\ncredit cards, ATMs, travelerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s checks, or cash. Before moving on, I tie up\nsome last-minute details and talk about travel insurance, car rental, and\npacking tips.\nPart III: South Florida\nThis part of the book deals with Miami, the Keys, the Everglades, Fort\nLauderdale, Palm Beach, and their Ã¢â‚¬â„¢burbs. I introduce the neighborhoods\nand then explore some of the modus transporto (local buses, trolleys,\ntaxis, shuttles, and other vehicles to get you from hither to yon). I also\ngive you some advice on where to stay, where to eat, and which attractions\nto see. Finally, I profile the best shopping areas, present the best\nclubs, and offer some suggested itineraries.\nPart IV: The Gulf Coast\nFloridaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s left coast has pockets of development, particularly around the\nTampa Bay area, but the Gulf Coast is not nearly as cramped as the\nAtlantic side.
