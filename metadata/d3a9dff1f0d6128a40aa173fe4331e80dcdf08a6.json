At night they pitch their camps between the gravestones and sit down to cook, eat and do their washing.\r\n\r\nIt seems that the city has grown used to its graveyard occupants, who have been a familiar sight since the 1950s. This documentary shows the everyday life of the children who live and play among the graves and tells of their hopes and dreams for the future.\r\n\r\nTechnical Spec\r\nVideo Codec: x265/HEVC CABAC   \r\nVideo Bitrate: CRF 23 (~735Kbps)\r\nVideo Resolution: 832x468\r\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\nFrame Rate: 25 FPS\r\nAudio Codec: HE-AAC\r\nAudio Bitrate: 64Kbps CBR 24KHz\r\nAudio Channels: 2 (Gaelic)\r\nRun-Time: 44 mins\r\nNumber of Parts: 1\r\nPart Size: 251 MB\r\nSource: PDTV\r\nSubtitles: Embedded English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3a9dff1f0d6128a40aa173fe4331e80dcdf08a6","amp;dn":"Soillse.2013.Cemetary.Full.of.Life.PDTV.x265-MVGroup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3a9dff1f0d6128a40aa173fe4331e80dcdf08a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,169,223,241,240,214,18,138,64,170,23,63,228,51,30,128,220,223,8,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
