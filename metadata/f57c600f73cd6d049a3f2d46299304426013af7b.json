He fascinates his audience with the way how he constructs each piece as he would construct a film scene.\n\nCinÃƒÂ©ma Beyrouth is of course a homage to the Beirut that still exists in our memory. Ã¢â‚¬Å“My main concern is that the compositions have a Ã¢â‚¬Å“soulÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. My artistic aim is to create intellectual and physical emotions but I do not dictate to the audience what they should feel. Everybody should keep his very own sensibility which is always influenced by the day, the surroundings, the atmosphere of the location.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ His charming concept to present his Arabic tinged music with Western jazz musicians and their instruments is a very individual approach to fusion East and West.\n\nWhen in the 70ties Lebaonon was to torn into pieces by the civil war Toufic Farroukh went into exile like many of his compatriots. Shortly before he had discovered jazz, the concept of jazz improvisation, Stan Getz and a Dexter Gordon concert convinced him to dedicate his life to music. He went o France and studied music for several years. The doors of the jazz clubs didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t open easily:Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ They put highest importance on virtuosity but I think that music shouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be considered they way sports is. I think the main thing is to find your own self and develop your own language.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ He worked mainly with Lebanese ensembles, was awarded several grants and soon he could present his first album Ali on Broadway. It was a fine, surprising success. His contacts to the film world grew and soon he got his first commissions to compose sound track music Ã¢â‚¬â€œ his music to Fallafel received an important French award.\n\nToufic Farroukh has established a solid career as saxophone soloist with his own groups and also as guest soloist e.g. with the project Arabian Nights by the Absolute Ensemble Kristjan Jaervi which is reflected by his steady concertizing at major festivals like:\nFestival Jazz ÃƒÂ  Germain des PrÃƒÂ©s / Jazz sur son 31 / Jazz ÃƒÂ  Foix / Jazz ÃƒÂ  Auray / Jazz ÃƒÂ  Commercy / Jazzellerault / JazzÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Velanet, La Rochelle / Jazz ÃƒÂ  Pointe ÃƒÂ  Pitre / North Sea Jazz festival (NL) / Tanjazz (Marokko) / Jazz Saarbruecken / DubaÃƒÂ¯ International Jazz Festival / Festival de Beitedine.
