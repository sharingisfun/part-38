But can they pull it off? The Property Brothers come to the rescue and help the couple find a budget-friendly dream home that can be renovated on time. With a budget that doesn't match the couple's expectations, Drew and Jonathan struggle to sell the potential of a fixer-upper. The couple decides between two renovation projects, and the brothers have less than four weeks to do a massive first-floor renovation. But the demolition reveals a flurry of unexpected and expensive surprises: the kitchen stack needs to be replaced, there's no heat in the kitchen or the upstairs, there's water damage in the ceiling, exposed live wires, and the plaster walls are beyond repair. As the couple's stress levels hit the roof, Jonathan springs into action \nto ensure the renovation runs smoothly\nIf you see &quot;Hector&quot; on the end of a file it means I capped it.\nEnjoy, Gaz/Hector :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:82a5003303081ef93d993e0fe2c30f63b027a369","amp;dn":"My.Dream.Home.s02e12.PDTV.x264.Hector.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"82a5003303081ef93d993e0fe2c30f63b027a369","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,165,0,51,3,8,30,249,61,153,62,15,226,195,15,99,176,39,163,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
