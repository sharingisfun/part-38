The rest of the established cast \nwas still there.  She's still mentioned by George, who is seen \nworking from his office rather than being at home.\n\nGracie died in 1964, which ironically was the same year that George returned \nto weekly television in &quot;Wendy and Me&quot; co-starring Connie Stevens.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5fd1118b13a37e8c185952e69f07caabca02a023","amp;dn":"THE+GEORGE+BURNS+SHOW+--+La+Vie+En+Rose","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5fd1118b13a37e8c185952e69f07caabca02a023","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,209,17,139,19,163,126,140,24,89,82,230,159,7,202,171,202,2,160,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
