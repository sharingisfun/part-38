This ensures that \nstudents well into the top 10% do not need to compete with each other. \nThey can cooperate, volunteer in the community, develop their personalities \nin other ways, learn a broader range of subjects etc.   There is no evidence \nthat selecting a student with 99% produces a better doctor than selecting a \nstudent with 90%.  But there is lots of evidence (and common sense) that says \nenforcing a dog-eat-dog competition, even among top students, selects \npathologically competitive personalities which are not likely to be well \nrounded, emphathetic, or compassionate.   In short, they are not likely to \nmake the best doctors.  \n\n-- freeflow123\n\nThe contained biographies cover... \n\nSamuel Adams\nAlexander the Great\nAristotle\nNiels Bohr\nOliver Cromwell\nCharles Darwin\nLeonardo da Vinci\nEmily Dickinson\nThomas Edison\nAlbert Einstein\nQueen Elizabeth I\nFranklin D.
