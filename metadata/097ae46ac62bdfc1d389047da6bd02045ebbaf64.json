Those in denial proclaim, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s too bigÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦it would unravelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦they\ncouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t keep it hiddenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nThe average person judges the world according to their moral compass. Because most\nindividuals are not ruthless, sociopathic control-freaks, they cannot even begin to fathom the dark gulfs that are the souls of the servants of the global elite.\nThe New World Order is a synthesis of the survivors of empires, of super-merchant\nfamilies, of barbarian kings, of banking families established in the middle-ages, and of the royal families of Europe. Over time, they have learned that if they can simply conceal the true magnitude of their power and install puppet rulers from the cultures they dominate, the people will accept greater forms of tyranny.\nIn the late 20th Century, as the formation of a true world government entered its final stages, the globalists began to do what was unthinkable just a few years before. They began to admit that there really was a move towards a New World Order, complete with a World Court, World Taxes and a World Army to enforce its despotic laws.\n\nJust a few years ago, the average man on the street refused to even admit the possibility of a world government. Now that same individual will bellow, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œYes, thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a world government ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and we need it to protect ourselves from terrorism!ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nThe globalistsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ plan is so far along that now they must admit that world government is a reality. Their propagandists are hailing the New World Order as the only system that will keep us safe and secure.\n\nIn reality, it is the world government itself which is conducting the terrorist acts.I can think of no better way to introduce this book than with a collection of quotes by members of the global elite touting this dehumanizing system.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:097ae46ac62bdfc1d389047da6bd02045ebbaf64","amp;dn":"911+-+Descent+into+Tyranny+-+By+Alex+Jones","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"097ae46ac62bdfc1d389047da6bd02045ebbaf64","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,122,228,106,198,43,223,193,211,137,4,125,166,189,2,4,94,187,175,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
