It was a place her husband had loved and she is determined to scatter his ashes there, but finds that the task is more difficult than she thought, on more than one level. An interesting piece of writing.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:92e08d2aa19dfec0cf0823687ea0a5656370848c","amp;dn":"Ashes+to+Antarctica+-+BBC+Radio+Drama","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"92e08d2aa19dfec0cf0823687ea0a5656370848c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,224,141,42,161,157,254,192,207,8,35,104,126,160,165,101,99,112,132,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
