But in the hands of this quintet the tempo drops\nand picks up, in intuitive ways that few groups of the time could manage. And\nHancock's classical upbringing brought a greater degree of impressionism than\nany pianist previously with Davis, save perhaps Bill Evans, although Hancock's\napproach already displayed a greater abstraction, something that would continue\nto evolve as the members of the quintet became even more comfortable with each\nother. The group's sense of dynamics are impeccable, most notably in the case of\nWilliams, who may have possessed the brashness of youth, but already\ndemonstrated a more mature vision than many drummers twice his age.\n\nWhile Coleman would eventually become a bone of contention, in particular with\nWilliams, at this point in the quintet's evolution he was a good fit. Yes, he may have\ntreated the rhythm section a bit too traditionally as a rhythm section, whereas Davis\nwas already letting it drive him as much as he directed it, but the disparity that\nwould become more evident later had yet to appear.\n\n\n\nPersonnel\n\n\nMiles Davis (trumpet), Ron Carter (bass), George Coleman (tenor saxophone on\ndiscs 1-5), Victor Feldman (piano on disc 1), Frank Butler (drums on disc 1), Herbie\nHancock (piano on discs 2-7), Tony Williams (drums on discs 2-7), Sam Rivers\n(tenor saxophone on disc 6), Wayne Shorter (tenor saxophone on disc 7)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.
