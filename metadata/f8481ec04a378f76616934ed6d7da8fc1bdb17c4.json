You start by choosing one of 17 different characters, e.g. Necromancer, Demonologist, Dwarf Queen, Troll King or maybe a High Priestess of Ba'al. The different character classes vary wildly in what special abilities they have and what parts of the world they should focus on conquering. E.g. the Demonologist needs sacrifices that you gain from towns and villages, but the Druid want special herbs that are found in forests. But of course gold is always good to have, so all classes can make use of a gold or silver mine, but only the Enchanter can make a Gold Golem out of it.  \n\nAs always, I would like to ask you to buy this game, if you like it (I did), Illwinter is a really small developer and they need it more than EA or Valve.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f8481ec04a378f76616934ed6d7da8fc1bdb17c4","amp;dn":"Conquest+of+Elysium","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f8481ec04a378f76616934ed6d7da8fc1bdb17c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,72,30,192,74,55,143,118,97,105,52,237,109,125,168,252,27,219,23,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
