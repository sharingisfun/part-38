Peter becomes immersed in the mysteries of an astonishing new environment, overseen by an enigmatic corporation known only as USIC. His work introduces him to a seemingly friendly native population struggling with a dangerous illness and hungry for Peter's teachings - his Bible is their &quot;book of strange new things&quot;. But Peter is rattled when Bea's letters from home become increasingly desperate: typhoons and earthquakes are devastating whole countries, and governments are crumbling. Bea's faith, once the guiding light of their lives, begins to falter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRead by Josh Cohen\r\nFormat: MP3\r\nBitrate: 64 Kbps\r\nUnabridged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd384335e99ecef58b0773a11319a10f041b1d52","amp;dn":"Michel+Faber+-+The+Book+of+Strange+New+Things","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd384335e99ecef58b0773a11319a10f041b1d52","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,56,67,53,233,158,206,245,139,7,115,161,19,25,161,15,4,27,29,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
