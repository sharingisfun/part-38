A genetically-engineered variant of the measles virus created by Dr. Alice Krippin (Emma Thompson), \n\nmeant as a cure for cancer, had mutated into a lethal strain. It spreads throughout the world, killing 90% of \n\nhumanity. By September 2012, Neville is the last healthy human in New York City; the rest of the plague's survivors \n\nhave degenerated into predatory, cannibalistic beings referred to as &quot;Darkseekers&quot;,[4] who hunt the immune humans \n\nas prey. The Darkseekers are so named for hiding during daylight due to a painful intolerance of UV radiation.\nNeville's daily routine includes experimenting on infected rats to find a cure for the virus and trips through a \n\ndecaying Manhattan to collect supplies from abandoned homes or hunt for the deer that have moved into the city. He \n\nalso keeps vigil each day for a response to his continuous recorded AM radio broadcasts, which instruct any \n\nsurvivors to meet him at midday at the South Street Seaport. Neville's isolation is broken only by the \n\ncompanionship of his German Shepherd Sam and interaction with mannequins he has set up as patrons of a video store.\nWhen one of his rat experiments shows a promising treatment, Neville sets a snare trap and captures an infected \n\nwoman. An enraged Darkseeker alpha male attempts to rescue her, but is driven back by the sunlight. In his \n\nlaboratory in the basement of his heavily fortified Washington Square Park home, Neville tries the new serum on the \n\ninfected woman, seemingly without success.\nThe next day, after finding one of his mannequins (&quot;Fred&quot;) out in the street in front of Grand Central Terminal, he \n\nis caught in a snare trap and passes out. He regains consciousness at dusk and frees himself, but is attacked by a \n\npack of infected dogs. Although Neville and Sam manage to kill the dogs, one bites Sam during the fight. Neville \n\nbrings Sam home and attempts to save the dog by injecting a strain of his serum, but it is too late; a heartbroken \n\nNeville is forced to kill his only companion.\nOvercome by grief and rage, Neville attacks a group of the infected the following night with his UV light equipped \n\nSUV. He manages to kill several Darkseekers, but they overwhelm and nearly kill him before he is rescued by a pair \n\nof immune humans, a woman named Anna (Alice Braga) and a boy named Ethan (Charlie Tahan), who followed his radio \n\nbroadcasts. Anna and Ethan take him back to his home, where Anna explains that they are making their way to a \n\nsurvivors' camp in Bethel, Vermont. Neville disputes that such a camp exists, and expresses his doubt when Anna \n\nsays God told her about it.\nThe following night, the alpha male leads a mob of Darkseekers in an attack on the house. Anna, who was unaware of \n\nNeville's precautions in covering his scent outside the house, inadvertently allows the Darkseekers to follow their \n\ntrail and discover Neville's home. When the Darkseekers charge the house, Neville uses UV worklights to push the \n\nmob back, but the infected easily shatter the lights and continue their attack. Neville kills the first wave of \n\nDarkseekers with claymore mines, but finds himself defenseless against the second wave. Neville tries to find Anna \n\nand Ethan, but before he can, a Darkseeker enters and attacks him. The Darkseeker retreats upstairs and begins \n\ntearing a hole in the roof so other infected can get in.\nAfter Neville saves Anna and Ethan, they hear the infected climbing the house, so they retreat into the basement \n\nlaboratory. They seal themselves in a reinforced plexiglass room with the infected woman, and they discover that \n\nNeville's treatment is in fact working: the subject looks much more human. The infected break in and the alpha male \n\nstarts throwing himself against the plexiglass, cracking the material. Realizing that the last treatment has been \n\nsuccessful, Neville draws a vial of the infected woman's blood and gives it to Anna before shutting them inside a \n\ncoal chute hidden in the back of the lab. He uses an M67 hand grenade to wipe out the attackers at the cost of his \n\nown life. Anna and Ethan are later seen driving in Vermont and stopping at the gated entrance to the survivors' \n\ncolony, where Anna hands over the antidote. In a voice-over, Anna claims that the survivors are Neville's legacy, \n\nas his fight for a cure became legend.\n\nAlternate ending\nIn the film's original ending, Neville realizes that the alpha male is identifying the woman he was experimenting \n\non by a butterfly tattoo, and that the alpha male wants her back. Neville puts his gun down and returns the \n\ninfected woman. Neville and the alpha male then exchange stares; Neville apologizes to the Darkseekers; the alpha \n\nmale acknowledges his apology, and the infected leave. The final shot follows Neville, Anna, and Ethan as they \n\ndrive away towards Vermont with the antidote.[5]\nDue to test audience's dislike of the film's original ending, several scenes were altered before the film's \n\nrelease, especially the stand-off between Neville and the infected in his laboratory. Visual effects supervisor \n\nJanek Sirrs recounts the original ending, starting with the standoff: &quot;At that point, Neville's ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the \n\naudience's ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ assumptions about the nature of these creatures are shown to be incorrect. We see that they have \n\nactually retained some of their humanity. There is a very important moment between the alpha male and Neville. The \n\nalpha male slapped his hand on the glass and smeared it, revealing a butterfly-shaped imprint.&quot;[/i][/b]\n\n[b][color=blue][i]::Trackers::[/i][/color][/b]\n[b][code] &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://exodus.desync.com:6969/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://exodus.desync.com:6969/announce&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://t1.pow7.com/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://t1.pow7.com/announce&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://pow7.com/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://pow7.com/announce&lt;/a&gt;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.publicbt.com:80/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.publicbt.com:80/announce&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.publicbt.com:80/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.publicbt.com:80/announce&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.publicbt.com/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.publicbt.com/announce&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://t1.pow7.com/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://t1.pow7.com/announce&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.publicbt.com/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.publicbt.com/announce&lt;/a&gt;\n\nudp://tracker.openbittorrent.com:80/announce\n\nudp://tracker.1337x.org:80/announce\n\nudp://tracker.1337x.org:80/announce\n\n\n[/code][/b]\n[b][color=red]Info Hash[/color]:[i]4F499775E89284E7DC355448035968ACBBF0B17E[/i][/b] \n\n\n[img]http://i.minus.com/iNLFjRXguvXUy.png[/img]\n\n[img]http://i.minus.com/iCJY9K3vsoeGe.png[/img]\n\n[img]http://i.minus.com/iSZfyXs41yQpz.png[/img]\n\n[img]http://i.minus.com/ibmLdO22TaYSks.png[/img]\n\n[img]http://i.minus.com/iw2Rkwe6kZCXn.png[/img]\n\n[img]http://i.minus.com/iCsrm1IrqG3Fu.png[/img]\n\n\n\n[img]http://i.minus.com/iyXzMn9tYeK00.gif[/img]\n\n[img]http://i.minus.com/ibg1o6jMcgIhji.png[/img][/center]\n\nWe are now also on FaceBook.
