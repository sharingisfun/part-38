Due out through Warner Music, the follow-up to 2013Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Holy Fire was recorded in a 19th-century mill in southern France with James Ford (Arctic Monkeys, HAIM, Mumford and Sons). The 10-track effort is a Ã¢â‚¬Å“primal, intense, sometimes harrowing album of extremesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ which touches Ã¢â‚¬Å“upon the depths of madness whilst also exhibiting some of the most beautiful pop songs the band have ever written,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ according to a press release.\n\n-320 CBR\n-5:01","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea6c717f4ab880e8029889ed06f88b7e8a531dc2","amp;dn":"Foals+-+What+Went+Down+%282015%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea6c717f4ab880e8029889ed06f88b7e8a531dc2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,108,113,127,74,184,128,232,2,152,137,237,6,248,139,126,138,83,29,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
