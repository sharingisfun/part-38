But it's been a fantastic run all the same, even if the duo has     |\n|   been focusing more on their psychedelic, progressive material as of        |\n|   late. With that said, the most impressive works in The Future Sound of     |\n|   London's back catalogue are some of the duo's earliest studio albums.      |\n|   The production of Lifeforms was well underway as Cobain and Dougans        |\n|   released Tales of Ephindrina under the Amorphous Androgynous banner in     |\n|   1993. Accordingly, whereas Tales of Ephindrina did a great job in          |\n|   combining the techno of the duo's earliest writings and the ambience of    |\n|   their later works, Lifeforms takes on a more complex, experimental         |\n|   structure. In doing this, The Future Sound of London not only cemented     |\n|   their status as one of the scene's top acts, but also crafted one of the   |\n|   genre's top records.                                                       |\n|                                                                              |\n|   If Lifeforms was held back by anything at all, it would certainly be its   |\n|   large volume of tracks. There are longer electronic albums from that       |\n|   era, of course; case in point, The Orb's Adventures Beyond the             |\n|   Ultraworld exceeds it by nearly twenty minutes. But with ninety-two        |\n|   minutes of material spread over nineteen songs on two discs, Lifeforms     |\n|   can make for quite the daunting listen nevertheless. That isn't to say     |\n|   that it's tedious, just a bit dense on the first few listens.              |\n|   Contributing to the album's arguably inaccessible aura is the              |\n|   experimental direction taken by Cobain and Dougans. Album opener           |\n|   &quot;Cascade&quot;, for example, opens with a minute and a half of alien sounding   |\n|   overtures and spacey samples, before transitioning into a melting pot of   |\n|   said samples, a subtle, synthesized ambience, and light beats. And         |\n|   though much of the double album is spent experimenting with a delicate     |\n|   sound built on sweeping samples and shrouds of electric noise, it would    |\n|   be a mistake to pigeonhole Lifeforms into having nineteen different        |\n|   versions of &quot;Cascade&quot;. One of the album's most impeccable aspects is its   |\n|   subtle format; there's just so much going on in nearly every song that     |\n|   you'll hear something new on each listen.                                  |\n|                                                                              |\n|   The album's antithesis, then, is its title track. A hit single in the      |\n|   UK, &quot;Lifeforms&quot; abandons the soft, discreet textures so predominately      |\n|   featured throughout the double album in favour of heavier ambient house    |\n|   influences. The song is owns one of Lifeforms' heaviest rhythm sections,   |\n|   making it one of the record's more in-your-face-type tracks, and           |\n|   certainly the catchiest. Parts of &quot;Among Myselves&quot; also echo the title     |\n|   track's dancier moments, but not without applying the oddities heard in    |\n|   virtually every other track. And despite standing out as two of the few    |\n|   truly danceable tracks on a primarily ambient album, both &quot;Lifeforms&quot;      |\n|   and &quot;Among Myselves&quot; hardly sound out of place.                            |\n|                                                                              |\n|   But as notable as the likes of &quot;Lifeforms&quot;, the driving &quot;Flak&quot; (which      |\n|   incidentally features guitarist Robert Fripp of King Crimson fame), and    |\n|   the almost frightening &quot;Spineless Jelly&quot; may be, the sheer scope of        |\n|   Lifeforms prevents it from being anything other than brilliant. Falling    |\n|   victim to the old quality vs. quantity debate, double albums tend to       |\n|   taper off the longer they go on. With Lifeforms, however, The Future       |\n|   Sound of London build off and improve on each subsequent track;            |\n|   consequently, to pinpoint a highlight is virtually impossible as nearly    |\n|   every song could make a case for such an honour. But such talk is moot     |\n|   in the end as Lifeforms is just such a rewarding record to listen to.      |\n|   It's dense. It's expansive. It's relaxing, engaging, intimate, strange,    |\n|   perhaps pretentious at times, and an assortment of other positive          |\n|   adjectives. But above all else, Lifeforms is a blast to listen to and      |\n|   ranks up with the Boards of Canadas, the Shpongles, The Orbs as for as     |\n|   90s electronic music is concerned.
