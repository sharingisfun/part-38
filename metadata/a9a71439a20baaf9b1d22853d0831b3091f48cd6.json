In addition to being a historical/drama/horror movie, it has anachronistic martial arts fight sequences; it also contains elements of erotica and humour. \n\nThe film had been called the highest grossing French movie ever, grossing over $70 million USD worldwide. Despite many enthusiactic reviews it was not a commercial success in the United States, grossing only $10 million USD. \n\nThe film has garnered a respectful following among horror fans and was also one of the sources of inspiration for the Dungeons and Dragons Eberron campaign setting. \n\nPlot \nSpoiler warning: Plot and/or ending details follow. \nSometime in the 18th Century, GrÃƒÂ©goire de Fronsac, the royal taxidermist of the French King Louis XV, and his Native American companion Mani, an Iroquois, arrive at GÃƒÂ©vaudan province to capture a mysterious beast which has been terrorizing the country side. The young Thomas, Marquis d&amp;#039;Apcher, befriends them and assists their investigation. \n\nFronsac is initially skeptical about the beast?s existence, since survivors describe it as much larger than any wolf he has ever seen. However, by studying the bite size on an unfortunate victim of the beast, he deduces that it must weigh roughly 500 pounds. Captain Duhamel, an army officer leading the hunt for the beast, has killed dozens of ordinary wolves, but never come close to the actual killer. \n\nWhile staying in GÃƒÂ©vaudan, Fronsac romances Marianne de Morangais, the daughter of a local count, whose brother, Jean- FranÃƒÂ§ois, was also an avid hunter and a world traveler, before losing one arm to a lion in Africa. Fronsac is also intrigued by Sylvia, a courtesan at the local brothel. \n\nWhile investigating another victim, Fronsac finds a fang made of steel, and his doubts of the Beast&amp;#039;s existence thin. Another witness swears that the Beast is controlled by a human master. Fronsac studies the patterns of the attacks and victims, trying to find a common thread and reveal a murderer. As the investigation proves to be unfruitful, the king&amp;#039;s weapons master, Lord Beauterne, arrives to put an end to the Beast. But instead of doing so, Beauterne kills an ordinary wolf and tells Fronsac to alter the corpse so it resembles the monster accordingly. Fronsac does so, and the bogus wolf is sent back to Paris, where it is put on display, much to the pleasure of the King and the French aristocracy. \n\nThe Beast and its MasterIn Paris, the King?s advisor shows Fronsac a copy of a book titled &quot;L&amp;#039;Ãƒâ€°difiante&quot; [translated: The Edifying] with treasonous theories, stating the Beast has come to punish the King of France for his indulgence of the philosophers, and that the modern embracement of science over religion is heresy. Fronsac realizes that the Beast is an instrument of a secret society, The Brotherhood of the Wolf, working to undermine public confidence in the King and ultimately take over the country. \n\nFronsac is told that ?officially? the Beast is dead, warned to keep his mouth shut, and bribed with an appointment to travel to Senegal. But back in GÃƒÂ©vaudan, the attacks by the real Beast continue. \n\nIgnoring his orders, Fronsac returns to GÃƒÂ©vaudan, determined to put an end to the Beast&amp;#039;s killings, and also to take Marianne away. Upon his return, the monster attacks and he sees it with his own eyes. It kills a man, but mysteriously refrains from attacking Marianne. \n\nFronsac, Mani, and the Marquis set out into the forest and set up an array of traps to capture the Beast, but it proves to be too powerful and intelligent to be captured by anything they can set up. After a violent encounter, Mani sets off solo in pursuit, where he finds a catacomb used as the Beast&amp;#039;s holding pen, inhabited by the Brotherhood and a band of Gypsies working with them. These include, ironically, an elderly veterinarian, the Beast?s tender, and his daughter, whom Mani saved from a beating when he and Fronsac first arrived in GÃƒÂ©vaudan. Outnumbered, Mani is shot in the back, overwhelmed and killed. \n\nFronsac is broken when he discovers his best friend has been murdered. Performing an autopsy, he finds a silver bullet, the signature weapon of Marianne&amp;#039;s brother, Jean-FranÃƒÂ§ois. In a fit of rage he goes to the catacombs and seeks revenge, finding a pile of copies of &quot;L&amp;#039;Ãƒâ€°difiante.&quot; He kills many of the Gypsies, and discovers the Beast?s lair. But then he is overpowered by the local authorities and imprisoned. \n\n\nMonica Bellucci as the courtesan SylviaSylvia visits him in jail and reveals to him that she is a spy for the Vatican. The local priest, Henri Sardis, is the leader of the Brotherhood, believing that he is restoring worship of God to France. The Pope has decided that Sardis is insane, and sent her to eliminate him. She then poisons Fronsac, telling him he knows too much. \n\nFronsac is presumed dead, and buried, when in fact Sylvia?s poison has only put him into a temporary coma. Marianne realizes that Jean-FranÃƒÂ§ois is the Beast?s master; it recognized his scent when it came near her, which is why it didn?t attack. Jean-FranÃƒÂ§ois, who has harbored an incestuous lust for his sister, rapes and nearly kills Marianne. \n\nSylvia?s agents exhume Fronsac and he appears at one of the Brotherhood?s secret sermons. In the climactic battle, he kills several Gypsies, and duels Jean-FranÃƒÂ§ois to the death. The other members of the Brotherhood attempt to flee, but are rounded up and arrested by Captain Duhamel and his men. Sardis escapes into the mountains, but is mauled to death by a pack of wolves, in an example of poetic justice. \n\nFronsac heals Marianne with a potion carried by Mani. He and the Marquis go to the Beast?s lair, where it lies grievously wounded after the fight in the forest. It turns out the Beast was an offspring of a strange animal Jean-FranÃƒÂ§ois brought back from Africa. It was tortured into becoming vicious, trained to attack humans, and dressed in metal armor to make it more formidable and frightening. Fronsac performs a mercy killing on the Beast. It is by now obvious that the &quot;Beast&quot; is a mistreated adult African lion. \n\nThe Marquis, now an old man, finishes writing his account of the killings, just before he is led to his execution by a revolutionary mob. \n\nIn the final scene, a flashback, Fronsac travels to Senegal with Marianne to start a new life together, scattering Mani?s ashes at sea. \n\nCast \n\nSamuel Le Bihan as GrÃƒÂ©goire de FronsacSamuel Le Bihan - GrÃƒÂ©goire de Fronsac \nVincent Cassel - Jean-FranÃƒÂ§ois de Morangias \nÃƒâ€°milie Dequenne - Marianne de Morangias \nMonica Bellucci - Sylvia \nJÃƒÂ©rÃƒÂ©mie Renier - Thomas d&amp;#039;Apcher \nMark Dacascos - Mani \nGaspard Ulliel - Louis \nJean Yanne - Comte de Morangias \nJean-FranÃƒÂ§ois StÃƒÂ©venin - Henri Sardis \nJacques Perrin - Thomas d&amp;#039;Apcher (old) \nEdith Scob - GeneviÃƒÂ¨ve de Morangias \nJohan Leysen - Beauterne \nBernard Farcy - Laffont \nHans Meyer - Marquis d&amp;#039;Apcher \nVirginie Darmon - La Bavarde \nPhilippe Nahon - Jean Chastel \n\nNOTE: Original movie release in France has French language.
