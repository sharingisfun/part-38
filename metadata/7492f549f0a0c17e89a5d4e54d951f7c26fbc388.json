The recordings have neither been artificially enhanced nor re-channeled for stereo effect. Disc transfer was accomplished using Studer tape machines and a computer-controlled Neumann lathe with a helium-cooled cutting head. Throughout the project, utmost care was used to preserve the remarkable quality of the tapes. Whenever possible, false starts and studio conversation have been left in. To enjoy the spirit of the original performances, we suggest you play this record at high volume.\n\n\n\nvinyl LP transfer at 24-bit 96khz\n\ntransfer info:\nNitty Gritty Record Master\nMusic Hall MMF 9.1\nsticky hand stylus cleaning\nGrado Master Reference 1 cartridge\nBellari VP-130 phono preamp, with vintage Telefunken 12AX7 smooth plates\nMytek Stereo192 ADC (analog to digital converter)\nTT Weights center weight, Blue Jean LC-1 interconnects\nsoftware used: Soundforge 10.0, ClickRepair 3.5.2 (in manual mode), Trader's Little Helper 2.7.0\nnote - one channel selected after manual declicking and copied to both channels\n\nflac fingerprints:\nA1 - Train Kept A-Rollin'.flac:7d6bf35e0d213c12982a801f822a985e\nA2 - Lonesome Train (On A Lonesome Track).flac:f5db073b92280d114aa934dad5dac7fe\nA3 - Oh Baby Babe.flac:c8a5321beb37387116ee4e87b4e5320e\nA4 - All By Myself.flac:ba63439d8b0c7705eb1aaa58770aa8cb\nA5 - Blues Stay Away From Me.flac:844b23180ecbe59a3c07093b690b9497\nA6 - Sweet Love On My Mind.flac:612bbdee7ba34cd9aefbbbe30de9b3b6\nA7 - Rock Therapy.flac:6a1303e58c4a77ad912e09af258b4593\nA8 - Please Don't Leave Me.flac:ab911fab0c7d09431dcc21b2f12c6a8e\nB1 - Rock Billy Boogie.flac:c608996d7eab63eb813b2ebd1eb758fc\nB2 - Drinkin' Wine, Spo-Dee-O-Dee.flac:0b885f8b86739bf57355597567a18b9f\nB3 - Tear It Up.flac:08e8948beebdf741eea1a9e905934906\nB4 - You're Undecided.flac:8b87fea90f83379d85ac1af0721f9a4f\nB5 - If You Want It Enough.flac:3d02b68fb1bdad5f11448b0b5f56ee90\nB6 - Eager Beaver Baby.flac:559a717b21fad24564fb20abd8be0bc9\nB7 - Your Baby Blue Eyes.flac:c18cac3d506c53f22cacc7e0d437c4e5\nB8 - Butterfingers.flac:8596e4f256a24c1fe695597ee949ea80\nB9 - Honey Hush.flac:03c0c1fa489b86854189f760570801a1\n_________________________________________________\n\nClassic rock &amp; roll from Memphis. The original LP that these guys made for Coral in 1956 goes for big $$$ if you can find one in decent shape. This 1978 issue has most of those tracks, plus a few single releases and alternate takes. I've seen this with a yellow cover, but I think the black cover came first. This was one of the first remasters that featured false starts and studio chatter. Obviously Jeff Beck and the Yardbirds were listening to these guys, as they covered &quot;Train Kept A-Rollin'&quot;, and it was covered more famously later by Aerosmith.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7492f549f0a0c17e89a5d4e54d951f7c26fbc388","amp;dn":"Johnny+Burnette++-+Tear+It+Up+%28Vinyl+24-96%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7492f549f0a0c17e89a5d4e54d951f7c26fbc388","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,146,245,73,240,160,193,126,137,165,212,229,77,149,31,124,38,251,195,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
