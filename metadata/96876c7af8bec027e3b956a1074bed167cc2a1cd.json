Over his father's objections, Friedrich enrolls, seeing this as his ticket out of factory life to university and a good salary. During his year in seventh column (fifth form), this innocence is altered as Friedrich encounters hazing, cruelty, death, and the Nazi code. His friendship with Albrecht, the ascetic son of the area's governor, is central to this education; a night in the forest hunting for escaped Russian POWs brings things to a head.\n  \nMax Riemelt  ...

In these schools, there was no room for debating opposing views or philosophical niceties like ends and means. The schools taught that only the strong survive. Anyone who showed any trace of independent thinking or sensitivity to human values were sadistically harassed and weeded out.\n\nBased on the recollections of his grandfather, Dennis GanselÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Before the Fall (Napola ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Elite fÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼r den FÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼hrer) is a riveting coming of age story about the training of one such Nazi elite in the Germany of 1942. The work transcends its limitations as a genre film to tackle a more universal theme - the struggle between external ideals and matters of inner conscience. Like Igor, the idealistic teenager in DardenneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s La Promesse, Friedrich Weimer (Max Riemelt), a Nordic-looking, working class boxer must deal with issues of conscience in an environment that is anathema to the assertion of human values.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIn my fortresses, we shall raise a young generation that will make the world tremble with fearÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Adolf Hitler\n\nWith this vision, Adolf Hitler created an ideology so potent and influential that the National-Political Institutes of Learning (Napolas) are remembered till this day. Napolas are military institutions that train cadets into Gauleiters, Head of the Nazi (NSDAP) district. The cadets are considered the superior breed and the elites of the Germans, destined to be future generals. And it is on this premise that the film Napola is based on. \n\nFriedrich Weimer (Max Riemelt) is a young, diligent lad working in Berlin in 1942. Coming from a working class family, he longs for a better life for himself and his family. His luck turned for the better when one day, his passion for boxing brought him nearer to his goal. In a boxing bout, his astounding agility and fighting prowess caught the eye of a recruiting officer Heinrich Vogler (Devid Striesow) from Napola. Impressed by his abilities, Heinrich invited Friedrich to join the prestigious Napola in Allenstein (a city in North-East Poland) and the latter willingly obliged. \n\nFriedrich met Albrecht Stein (Tom Schilling) in a chance encounter during his training and discovered that he is the son of a high-ranking German officer. Contrary to FriedrichÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ruggedness and grit, Albrecht comes across as weak and soft. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s this characteristics of Albrecht that prompts Friedrich to be protective towards him. And itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the deep friendship forged between them that ultimately makes Friedrich question his belief and change his life forever.\n\nDirector Dennis Gansel has crafted a masterpiece out of this film. He illustrates vividly how young innocent adolescents are indoctrinated by Nazism, a form of fascist ideology (the dominant and oppressive, violent control by a dictator through terror and censorship, which involves racism at times). He enables the audience to experience the dilemma faced by the young cadets, which is to choose between being subservient to the Third Reich or risked losing all through expulsion. And most importantly, it allows the audience to catch a glimpse of the practices of the Nazis, their wanton killings of Russian POWs and the crazed desire to excel, even among their own breed. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s definitely Darwinism Theory stretched beyond the limit. \n\nThe contrast in character between the two male leads and their different views on Nazism are also interesting highlights of the film. Being able-bodied, Friedrich senses the fragility in Albrecht and tries to make him stronger through encouragement. Albrecht, on the other hand, tried to talk Friedrich out of serving the school and abiding by their ideology. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s this conflict of interest between them and the ultimate decisions that they made that truly makes this film one of the finest in German cinema, and possibly in the international film arena as well. As at time of typing, this film has already garnered several wins and being screened in various film festivals.\n\nThere have been several war films being made over the past years, such as Roman PolanskiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s The Pianist (2002), seeing the brutality of war through the eyes of a Jew. Then thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the TV series Hitler: The Rise of Evil (2003), a biography that traces the life of Adolf Hitler. And thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Downfall (2004), a recent film that narrates the last hours of the German dictator. However, nothing comes as close to this film as Steven SpielbergÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s SchindlerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s List (1993), both of which portrays a Good Samaritan in a German. While Oskar Schindler may be seen as a German rescuing the helpless Jews, a more poignant portrayal is seen in this film in the form of the two male protagonists vacillating between accepting and rejecting the ideology of Nazism. It exemplifies the fact that there exists individuals who renounce Nazism and defy its ideology that is imposed on them. \n\nThis is a film that doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t follow conventional practice of basing the story directly on the Holocaust and the Third Reich but rather, provides an alternative voice. In the past, war films have placed their focus on the cruelty and brutality in the battlefield with little or no character focus. This film goes beyond traditional filmmaking in this genre by placing a humane face to the film, with characterisation of the protagonists superceding events. \n\nWhile some viewers may feel that the film is biased (considering that it is fictitious and produced by a German director), it is enlightening to know that the story adheres closely to actual events. That the Germans actually acknowledge the few unsung heroes who dared to resist the ideologies of Hitler and willing to pay the price for defiance are commendable.\n\nThe freshness found in the subject matter in NaPolA morphs into a cautionary tale of how easily the youth can be molded and shaped. I found the experience of watching Friedrich slowly become something he really wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t quite absorbing. Friedrich isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t a Nazi, most of the students at his academy are as far as you can get from being a Nazi. But they salute just like a Nazi, they wear the swastika, they go through the motions, they become like Nazis without intending to. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s telling that FriedrichÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s great uprising doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t result from a rebellion against Nazism but rather as a result of the actions of the abusive father of a friend. With every step Friedrich, and the rest of the boys, takes itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s like he delves further and further into a massive costume. He wants to be a great boxer, a good student and a man, but he doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t know how to be any of those things so he does what his school says and thinks nothing of it. Can you truly label someone a Nazi if he is being molded by the school he attends? I say the answer is no and that is why itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s entertaining to watch Friedrich as he becomes one with the machine.\n\nI have no doubt that the above way of thinking was present in the director and co-writer Dennis GanselÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s mind. He peppers NaPolA with images of Nazism, most notably the swastika and the German flag, in places that donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t quite seem right. For some reason when you put the Nazi flag behind a boxing ring it just doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t seem right, it doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t fit. This mirrors the boys we see in the school, because for the most part the label of Nazi that their teachers will bestow upon them just doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t seem right, it most certainly doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t fit. NaPolA feels right as a movie, but I never felt that the school children felt like they belonged next to that Nazi symbol and all the trappings of Nazism that we see throughout the film. Please donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t misconstrue what I am saying, I do realize that I have not been exactly clear in my point, but what I just wrote is a good thing. Those kids arenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Nazis, they are just kids and I feel Mr. Gansel is giving us a slice of history while saying that these kids were no different than any other kid throughout history. They were easily swayed and molded to what the Nazi party wanted them to be, and isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t that what most schools here in the land of the free and the brave do today, mold kids into what our society deems they should be?\n\nNaPolA stumbles a bit in its portrayal of Heinrich Stein, he is a bit too on the nose as AlbrechtÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s father. He serves his purpose, but IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m not sure if his purpose was necessary. The story doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t really need him to say what it needs to say, or at the very least the character didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t need to be so relentlessly one dimensional. Mr. Gansel also could have opened up a bit more with his camera. I couldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t shake the feeling that the beauty he did find with his camera could have happened more often. He did manage to avoid all the usual sports tropes though, and for that I salute him.\n\nI was looking for a nice change of pace in my World War II Marathon, and NaPolA provided that while also managing to be a very good film. DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t get me wrong, I love World War II, and I love a good World War II movie that delves into the war or the Holocaust. But, NaPolA was different in a good way and when done right thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s nothing wrong with different. NaPolA isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t really a sports movie either, just in case thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s what the blurbs on the DVD slip left you thinking. NaPolA is an engaging treatise on the molding of children in perhaps the most interesting time in all of history. Most of all NaPolA is a very good film that deserves to be seen by more people, so give it a chance why donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t ya!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:96876c7af8bec027e3b956a1074bed167cc2a1cd","amp;dn":"NAPOLA+Elite+fur+den+F%26Atilde%3B%26frac14%3Bhrer+%28eng+subs%29+%5B2004%5D+Den","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"96876c7af8bec027e3b956a1074bed167cc2a1cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,135,108,122,248,190,192,39,227,185,86,161,7,75,237,22,124,194,161,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
