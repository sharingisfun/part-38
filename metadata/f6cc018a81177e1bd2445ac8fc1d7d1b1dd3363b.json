And of all the FBI agents in Illinois, it had to be Special Agent Jack Pallas who gets assigned to this high-profile homicide. The same Jack Pallas who still blames Cameron for a botched crackdown three years agoÃ¢â‚¬â€and for nearly ruining his career.\nInto each other's arms...\nWork with Cameron Lynde? Are they kidding? Maybe, Jack thinks, this is some kind of welcome-back prank after his stint away from Chicago. But it's no joke; the pair is going to have to put their rocky past behind them and focus on the case at hand. That is, if they can cut back on the razor-sharp jibesÃ¢â‚¬â€and smother the flame of their sizzling-hot sexual tension.\n\nA Lot like Love\nThe FBI wants her cooperation...\nAs the daughter of a billionaire and the owner of the city's top wine store, Jordan Rhodes is invited to the most exclusive parties in Chicago. But there's only one party the FBI wants to crash: the charity fundraiser of a famous restaurateur, who also happens to launder money for the mob. In exchange for her brother's release from prison, Jordan is going to be thereÃ¢â‚¬â€with a date supplied by the Bureau.\nAgent McCall just wants her...\nAs the top undercover agent in Chicago, Nick McCall has one rule: never get personal. This &quot;date&quot; with Jordan Rhodes is merely an assignmentÃ¢â‚¬â€one they're both determined to pull off even if they can't be together for five minutes before the sarcasm and sparks begin to fly. But when Nick's investigation is compromised, he and Jordan have no choice but to pretend they're a couple, and what starts out as a simple assignment begins to feel a lot like something more.\n\nAbout That Night\nHe's Playing Games\nThough Rylann Pierce tried to fight the sparks she felt for billionaire heir Kyle Rhodes the night they met, their sizzling chemistry was undeniable. But after being stood up on their first date, Rylann never expected to see him again. So when she finds herself face-to-face with Kyle in a courthouse nine years later, she's stunned. More troubling to the beautiful assistant U.S. attorney is that she's still wildly attracted to him.\nBut She's Making The Rules\nJust released from prison, Kyle Rhodes isn't thrilled to be the star witness in a high-profile criminal caseÃ¢â‚¬â€but when Rylann comes knocking at his door, he finds she may be the one lawyer he can't say no to. Still as gorgeous and sharp-tongued as ever, she lays down the law: she doesn't mix business with pleasure. But Kyle won't give up on something he wantsÃ¢â‚¬â€and what he wants is the one woman he's never forgotten.\n\nLove Irresistibly\nHEÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S USED TO GETTING WHAT HE WANTSÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\nA former football star and one of ChicagoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s top prosecutors, Assistant U.S. Attorney Cade Morgan will do anything to nail a corrupt state senator, which means he needs Brooke ParkerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s help. As general counsel for a restaurant company, she can get a bug to the senatorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s table at one of her five-star restaurants so the FBI can eavesdrop on him. All Cade has to do is convince Brooke to cooperateÃ¢â‚¬â€and heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not afraid to use a little charm, or the power of his office, to do just that.\nAND WHAT HE WANTS IS HER.\nA savvy businesswoman, Brooke knows she needs to play ball with the U.S. AttorneyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s officeÃ¢â‚¬â€even if it means working with Cade. No doubt thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a sizzling attraction beneath all their sarcastic quips, but Brooke is determined to keep things casual.
