Searchable pdf (clearscan) with contents in bookmarks, accurate pagination and metadata, etc.\n\n\nHistory of May '68 and leftist critique of the traditional left.\n\n\ndescription:\n\nIn May 68 a student protest spread to other universities, to Paris factories and in a few weeks to most of France. A million Parisians marched; ten million workers went out on strike. At the center of the fray was Daniel Cohn-Bendit. Obsolete Communism was written in 5 weeks immediately after the state regained control, and no account of May 68 can match its immediacy or urgency.\n\nThe book combines an account of the events of May 1968 with a critique of Stalinism, the French Communist Party and the trade union establishment. It remains available today and has had some lasting influence on anarchist and socialist thought.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d208ec603b377d6e63c4ca366ee8ba6fdcc0c8e","amp;dn":"Daniel+and+Gabriel+Cohn-Bendit+-+Obsolete+Communism+%28pdf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d208ec603b377d6e63c4ca366ee8ba6fdcc0c8e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,32,142,198,3,179,119,214,230,60,76,163,102,238,139,166,253,204,12,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
