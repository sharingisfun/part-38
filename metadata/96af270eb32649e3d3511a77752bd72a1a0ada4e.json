This release 1993 on 'Milestone'.\n\nReview by Scott Yanow:\nSonny Rollins mostly sticks to standard ballads on this excellent CD which finds him joined by trombonist Clifton Anderson, pianist Tommy Flanagan, bassist Bob Cranshaw, drummer Jack DeJohnette and, on two selections, a five-piece brass choir arranged by Jimmy Heath. Comfortable and occasionally passionate music by one of the classic tenor-saxophonists.\n\nPersonnel as above on tracks 2-6.\n\nPlus on tracks 1 &amp; 7:\nJon Faddis &amp; Byron Stripling - Flugelhorn\nAlex Brofsky - French Horn\nBob Stewart - Tuba\n\n01. Darn That Dream   \n02. Where Or When   \n03. My Old Flame    \n04. Times Slimes    \n05. I See Your Face Before Me   \n06. Delia    \n07. Prelude To A Kiss \n\n   \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:96af270eb32649e3d3511a77752bd72a1a0ada4e","amp;dn":"Sonny+Rollins+-+Old+Flames+%28FLAC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"96af270eb32649e3d3511a77752bd72a1a0ada4e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,175,39,14,179,38,73,227,211,81,26,119,117,43,215,42,26,10,218,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
