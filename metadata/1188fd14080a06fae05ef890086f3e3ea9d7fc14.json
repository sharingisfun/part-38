Includes liner notes by Jon Sutherland.\n\nOne of the premier live rock albums of the '70s, STRANGERS features a band at its ...    Full Descriptionpeak performing all its hits and fan favorites. The album was recorded during two nights in Ohio in 1978, when the band opened for Blue Oyster Cult. This reissue features remastered sound, extended liner notes, and the correct track sequencing.\n\nThe album's two bonus tracks, &quot;Hot 'N' Ready&quot; and &quot;Cherry,&quot; get the album started in supreme hard-rock fashion. &quot;Out in the Street&quot; shows why Phil Mogg is overlooked as one of the premier hard-rock vocalists of his era, while &quot;Only You Can Rock Me&quot; features the guitar prowess of Michael Schenker. &quot;Doctor Doctor&quot; is probably the band's most well-known song, and this live version is more powerful than the studio original. The same can be said of &quot;Lights Out,&quot; the title track of the band's most successful album. The band comes together and kicks it hard on the thunderous &quot;Rock Bottom.&quot; Combining elements of metal, hard rock, and progressive rock, UFO's well-crafted compositions are every bit as good as those of lauded peers like Blue Oyster Cult and Thin Lizzy.\n\nDigitally remastered by Bob Norberg (Capitol Mastering).\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://denis.stalker.h3q.com:6969/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://denis.stalker.h3q.com:6969/announce&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.torrent-downloads.to:2710/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.torrent-downloads.to:2710/announce&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.openbittorrent.com/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.openbittorrent.com/announce&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.torrentbox.com:2710/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.torrentbox.com:2710/announce&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1188fd14080a06fae05ef890086f3e3ea9d7fc14","amp;dn":"UFO+-+Strangers+In+The+Night+%28EAC.FLAC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1188fd14080a06fae05ef890086f3e3ea9d7fc14","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,136,253,20,8,10,6,250,224,94,248,144,8,111,62,62,169,215,252,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
