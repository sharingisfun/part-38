You want to write flexible, maintainable web applications.\nYou want to use Ruby and Rails. But can you justify the move away from established platforms such as J2EE?\nBruce TateÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s From Java to Ruby has the answers, and it expresses them in a language thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll help persuade\nmanagers and executives whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve seen it all. See when and where the switch makes sense, and see how to make it.\n\nHow To Adopt New Technology\n\nIf youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re trying to adopt Ruby in your organization and need some help, this is the book for you.\n\nBased on a decision tree (a concept familiar to managers and executives) Java to Ruby stays above\nthe low-level technical debate to examine the real benefits and risks to adoption.\n\nJava to Ruby is packed with interviews of Ruby customers and developers, so you can see what types\nof projects are likely to succeed, and which ones are likely to fail.\n\nRuby and Rails may be the answer, but first, you need to be sure youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re asking the right question.\nBy addressing risk and fitness of purpose, Java to Ruby makes sure youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re asking the right questions first.\n\nBecause technology adoption is only the beginning, Java to Ruby walks you through the whole lifecycle\nof prototype, ramp up, and production and deployment.\n\nDevelopers often struggle beneath JavaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mountains of complexity, even though the project might not need\nJava at all. Led by the powerful and productive Ruby on Rails framework, Ruby offers incredible productivity, surprising performance, and ultimately developer satisfaction. Java developers often know better languages are out there, but canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t always communicate the benefits to their management chain.\n\nEnter Java to Ruby. Most books talk about the benefits of technology, but risk, skills, and fit also come into play.\nOther books cannot overcome the most basic management objection: risk. This book attacks user objections head on, in\nlanguage friendly to developers and managers.\n\n\n\n160 pages\nPublished: 2006-06-01\nRelease: P1.0 (2006-06-21)\nISBN: 978-0-9766-9409-0\n\nIf you download this upload, please make sure you seed it till atleast 1:1 ratio. We all work very hard to get this stuff. Even a little help is greatly appreciated.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80d1b6eca8e3eb6a4859ebf75798963bb5a0c3a3","amp;dn":"From+Java+to+Ruby+%5BLittleFairy+RG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80d1b6eca8e3eb6a4859ebf75798963bb5a0c3a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,209,182,236,168,227,235,106,72,89,235,247,87,152,150,59,181,160,195,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
