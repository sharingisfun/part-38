Maverick is a gambler who would rather con someone than fight them. He needs an additional three thousand dollars in order to enter a Winner Take All poker game that begins in a few days. He tries to win some, tries to collect a few debts, and recover a little loot for the reward, all with a light hearted air. He joins forces with a woman gambler with a marvelous, though fake, southern accent as the two both try and enter the game. \n\nInfo: \n\nVideo:688x304 \nFrames:23.976 \nLen:2:06:36 \nFrms:182,10 \nkbps:723 \nQf:0.144 \n\nAudio: \n0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3 \n48000Hz 128 kb/s tot,Joint Stereo \n\nFile Length Correct \nDivX Style &quot;packed bitstream&quot; AVI \nOpenDML (AVI v2.0) \nInterleave: 1 vid frame (42 ms), preload=504 \nAudio frames: Split across interleaves \nVideo: 655 MB (84.05%) \nAudio: 116 MB (14.88%) \nAVI Overhead: 8.34 MB (1.07%) \n\n[ISFT] VirtualDubMod 1.5.10.1 (build 2366/release) \n[JUNK] VirtualDubMod build 2366/release \n[USER] DivX503b1393p \n[USER] XviD0041 \n\nEnjoy....","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:156da7f27a0aa283fb836f95a7a0e7f8b17b945d","amp;dn":"Maverick-DVDRip%5BEng%5D1994.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"156da7f27a0aa283fb836f95a7a0e7f8b17b945d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,109,167,242,122,10,162,131,251,131,111,149,167,160,231,248,177,123,148,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
