Often, those most at risk are the least able to access professional help.\n\nReducing Suicide provides a blueprint for addressing this tragic and costly problem: how we can build an \nappropriate infrastructure, conduct needed research, and improve our ability to recognize suicide risk and \neffectively intervene. Rich in data, the book also strikes an intensely personal chord, featuring compelling \nquotes about people s experience with suicide. The book explores the factors that raise a person s risk of \nsuicide: psychological and biological factors including substance abuse, the link between childhood trauma and \nlater suicide, and the impact of family life, economic status, religion, and other social and cultural \nconditions. The authors review the effectiveness of existing interventions, including mental health \npractitioners ability to assess suicide risk among patients. They present lessons learned from the Air Force \nsuicide prevention program and other prevention initiatives. And they identify barriers to effective research \nand treatment.\n\nThis new volume will be of special interest to policy makers, administrators, researchers, practitioners, and \njournalists working in the field of mental health.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f8e25881aff174551bd62c0eb9373c585a5c1f9","amp;dn":"Reducing+Suicide%3A+A+National+Imperative.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f8e25881aff174551bd62c0eb9373c585a5c1f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,142,37,136,26,255,23,69,81,189,98,192,235,147,115,197,133,165,193,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
