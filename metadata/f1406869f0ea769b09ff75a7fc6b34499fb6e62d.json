Released on 4 November 1991, Loveless was recorded over a two-year period between 1989 and 1991 in nineteen recording studios. Lead vocalist and guitarist Kevin Shields dominated the recording process; he sought to achieve a particular sound for the record, making use of various techniques such as guitars strummed with a tremolo bar, sampled drum loops, and obscured vocals. A large number of engineers were hired and fired during the process, although the band finally gave credit on the album sleeve to anyone who was present during the recordings, &quot;even if all they did was make tea&quot;, according to Shields.[1] The recording of Loveless is rumored to have cost Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£250,000, a figure that came close to bankrupting the band&amp;#039;s record label Creation Records.\n\nMy Bloody Valentine&amp;#039;s relationship with Creation Records deteriorated during the album&amp;#039;s recording, and the band was removed from the label due to the difficulty and expense of working with Shields. While the album was not a great commercial success, Loveless was well received by critics. The album is widely regarded as a landmark of the alternative rock genre, and is frequently cited by critics as one of the best albums of the 1990s. A number of My Bloody Valentine&amp;#039;s contemporaries, including Billy Corgan of The Smashing Pumpkins and Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails, have cited the album as an influence on their music.\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n   1. &quot;Only Shallow&quot; (Bilinda Butcher, Kevin Shields) ÃƒÂ¢?? 4:17\n   2. &quot;Loomer&quot; (Butcher, Shields) ÃƒÂ¢?? 2:38\n   3. &quot;Touched&quot; (Colm O&amp;#039;Ciosoig) ÃƒÂ¢?? 0:56\n   4. &quot;To Here Knows When&quot; (Butcher, Shields) ÃƒÂ¢?? 5:31\n   5. &quot;When You Sleep&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 4:11\n   6. &quot;I Only Said&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 5:34\n   7. &quot;Come in Alone&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 3:58\n   8. &quot;Sometimes&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 5:19\n   9. &quot;Blown a Wish&quot; (Butcher, Shields) ÃƒÂ¢?? 3:36\n  10. &quot;What You Want&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 5:33\n  11. &quot;Soon&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 6:58\n\nEnjoy!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f1406869f0ea769b09ff75a7fc6b34499fb6e62d","amp;dn":"Indie+Classic%21%3A+My+Bloody+Valentine+-+Loveless+%5B1991%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f1406869f0ea769b09ff75a7fc6b34499fb6e62d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,64,104,105,240,234,118,155,9,255,117,167,252,107,52,73,159,182,230,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
