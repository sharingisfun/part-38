A victim of a brutal family raping of which only he survived. Deathwish was first introduced in issue 5 going up against Hardware; Deathwish appeared in Hardware six times and got his own 4 issue spinoff mini-series in December, 1994. It was notable for its use of a pre-operative transsexual protagonist and the exclamation to close the third issue: &quot;Fuck art! Let's dance!&quot; (The comic was penned by Maddie Blaustein)\n\nSince I'll be done ULing Hardware http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6973719/Hardware_(Milestone)_Complete by morning, here's the Milestone spinoff from the series.
