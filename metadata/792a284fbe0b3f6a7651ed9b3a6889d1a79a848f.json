His relaxed, lolling boogie-woogie piano style and easygoing, warm vocals anchored a long series of national hits from the mid-'50s to the early '60s. Through it all, his basic approach rarely changed. He may not have been one of early rock's most charismatic, innovative, or threatening figures, but he was certainly one of its most consistent. ...\n\nTo read the entire bio: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:jbfoxql5ldae~T1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:jbfoxql5ldae~T1&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review:\n\nFor the budget-minded fan, this 20-track single-disc compilation of Fats Domino's Imperial smashes will serve nicely. Not much of his early pre-rock stuff -- &quot;The Fat Man&quot; and &quot;Please Don't Leave Me&quot; are all that are here -- but there's plenty of his hit-laden output from 1955 on -- &quot;Ain't It a Shame,&quot; &quot;Blue Monday,&quot; &quot;I'm in Love Again,&quot; &quot;Blueberry Hill,&quot; &quot;I'm Ready,&quot; among others. One small but substantial difference between this set and the larger packages: It uses non-sped-up masters of his mid-'50s material (some of his hits from this era were mastered slightly faster than true pitch). Even if they're not historically correct, these versions actually sound better.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:aifwxqt5ldhe&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:aifwxqt5ldhe&lt;/a&gt;\n\nReviews and MP3 album here: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000DRAF&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000DRAF&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
