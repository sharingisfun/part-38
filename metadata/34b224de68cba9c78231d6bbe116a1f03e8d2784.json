The tracks are spacey meditation jams â€“ sometimes quite out, sometimes mellow and soulful â€“ and titles include &quot;Guru Sri Chinmoy Aphorism â€“ Angel Of Air&quot;, &quot;Angel Of Water&quot;, &quot;Angel Of Sunlight&quot;, and &quot;Illuminations&quot;.\r\n\r\nAt the time of this recording, Carlos Santana was using the spiritual name Devadip, given to him by his personal guru Sri Chinmoy. Alice Coltrane, John's widow, was also a seeker with a guru of her own. She changed her name to Turiyasangitananda. She later used a shorter version as a first name. Officially, the artists named on this album were Devadip Carlos Santana and Turiya Alice Coltrane.\r\n\r\nIn the 1970s, Santana's admiration for John Coltrane knew no bounds. This respect went beyond the music. Santana was, as many were in those days, &quot;trying to find himself.&quot; Coltrane's spiritual path was of great interest to him. It is not so surprising that one day he would play music with someone who had a connection to the man, the music and the spirit.\r\n\r\nAlice Coltrane played piano in her husband's last band. The avant-garde music Coltrane was playing toward the end of his life was very much in her bag. Some angry Coltrane fans blamed her for influencing this last and least popular direction. She responded by suggesting that nobody led John Coltrane anywhere, and that she was playing what he asked her to play.\r\n\r\nThe orchestral ambience, spiritual overtones, collaborative success and the fusion-guitar anthem make this one of the more fulfilling jazz-rock performances of Santana's career. For some reason, it remains among his lesser-known accomplishments.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTracklist:\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n01 - Guru Sri Chinmoy Aphorism\r\n02 - Angel Of Air-Angel Of Water\r\n03 - Bliss-The Eternal Row\r\n04 - Angel Of Sunlight\r\n05 - Illuminations\r\n\r\nÂ© 1974, 2006 Columbia / 485810 2\r\n\r\n\r\nPersonnel:\r\nCarlos Santana - guitar\r\nAlice Coltrane - harp, piano\r\nTom Coster - electric piano, Hammond organ, piano\r\nDave Holland - acoustic bass\r\nJack DeJohnette â€“ cymbals, drums\r\nJulse Broussard â€“ flute,soprano sax\r\nPrabuddha Phil Browne â€“ tamboura\r\nArmando Perez - congas\r\nPhil Ford - tablas\r\n\r\nString Section:\r\nMurray Adler, Ron Folsom, Bill Henderson, Nathen Kaproff, Gordon Marron, Paul Shure, Charles Veal -violin\r\nAnne Goodman, Glenn Grab, Jackie Lustgarten, Fred Seykora - cello\r\nMarilyn Baker, Myer Bello, Rollice Dale, Alan Harshman, Myra Kestenbaum, David Schwartz - viola\r\nJimmy Bond - bass\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoy and Sharing, Thanks!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:34b224de68cba9c78231d6bbe116a1f03e8d2784","amp;dn":"Carlos+Santana+%26amp%3B+Alice+Coltrane+-+Illuminations+%281974%29+%5BEAC-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"34b224de68cba9c78231d6bbe116a1f03e8d2784","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,178,36,222,104,203,169,199,130,49,214,187,225,22,161,240,62,141,39,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
