He was exposed to a massive amount of radiation in an attempt to assist a fellow worker, Dr. Bentley while trying to avert an imminent meltdown due to sabotage of a nuclear power facility by Dr. Rasp, an agent of Nuro.  Solar amazingly survived and soon discovered that he had powers to convert his human form into any kind of energy (E = mcÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â²).  Using his new powers, he began searching for the &quot;mastermind&quot; behind the plot responsible for the sabotage of the nuclear lab that caused his condition in the first place.  This evil mastermind, named Nuro was a continuing character Doctor Solar clashed with many times. \n\nHis original run lasted 27 issues, from October 1962 to April 1969.  In the early 1980s, the series was resumed with issue #28 and lasted four issues.  Solar also appeared in an issue of another Gold Key title, Dr. Spektor #14.  The character was later licensed and updated by Valiant Comics during the 1990s.\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:415ca30adfea2529d3532dc6bddaa6c620fbdc6f","amp;dn":"Doctor+Solar%2C+Man+of+the+Atom+%28Gold+Key%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"415ca30adfea2529d3532dc6bddaa6c620fbdc6f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,92,163,10,223,234,37,41,211,83,45,198,189,218,166,198,32,251,220,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
