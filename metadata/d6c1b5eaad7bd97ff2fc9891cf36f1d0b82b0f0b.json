The centerpiece is &quot;Wuthering Heights,&quot; which was a hit everywhere except the United States (and propelled the Emily BrontÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â« novel back onto the best-seller lists in England), but there is a lot else here to enjoy: The disturbing &quot;Man with the Child in His Eyes,&quot; the catchy rocker &quot;James and the Cold Gun,&quot; and &quot;Feel It,&quot; an early manifestation of Bush's explorations of sexual experience in song, which would culminate with &quot;Hounds of Love.&quot; As those familiar with the latter well know, she would do better work in the future, but this is still a mightily impressive debut.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6c1b5eaad7bd97ff2fc9891cf36f1d0b82b0f0b","amp;dn":"Kate+Bush+-+The+Kick+Inside+%281978%29+%5BEAC-LAME+320kbps%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6c1b5eaad7bd97ff2fc9891cf36f1d0b82b0f0b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,193,181,234,173,123,217,127,242,252,152,145,207,54,241,208,184,43,15,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
