Sporting a range of ingenious new features, CleanMyMac lets you safely and intelligently scan and clean your entire system, delete large, unused files, reduce the size of your iPhoto library, uninstall unneeded apps or fix the ones that started to work improperly, manage all your extensions from one place and do much more â€“ all from one newly designed and beautifully simple interface.\r\nClean, optimize, and maintain your Mac with the all-new CleanMyMac 3. It scans every inch of your system, removes gigabytes of junk in just two clicks, and monitors the health of your Mac.\r\n\r\nFeatures:-\r\n\r\nYour Mac deserves its own cleaning genius:-\r\n\r\nCleanMyMac 3 shows you what to clean, you just have to choose when. It scans everything on your Mac, including your Macâ€™s system, iTunes, Mail, iPhoto, Trash bins, and even old folders that have been secretly avoiding you. Plus, it knows exactly what can be safely cleaned from your Mac and what canâ€™t. Almost like itâ€™s got a brain or something. \r\n\r\nA System for cleaning yours up:-\r\n\r\nWhenâ€™s the last time you used one of your apps in Swahili? What about Tetum? Thatâ€™s what we thought. And, thereâ€™s more than just language files that are wasting space on your system. CleanMyMac 3 lets you get rid of all the added extras on your Mac, without the worry of removing a critical file.\r\n\r\nMail is a lot heavier than it looks:-\r\n\r\nEach and every attachment you receive in Mail, from PDFs to signatures, get saved to your Mac. Know what that amounts to? A lot. Plus, if you want to manually clean out those gigabytes of attachments, youâ€™d have to crawl through your entire mailbox searching for every single paper clip. Save yourself the trouble â€” CleanMyMac 3 is happy to take care of it for you.  \r\n\r\nBring old files out of the depths:-\r\n\r\nUse CleanMyMac 3 to discover all the old files youâ€™ve forgotten about on your hard drive. It scans folders and disk drives to show you the files that havenâ€™t been opened in a long time. Why hang onto stuff you never use? Let CleanMyMac 3 gather it all together, and then you decide whatâ€™s worth keeping.\r\n\r\nMost homes have more than one trash bin:-\r\n\r\nMacs do too, and CleanMyMac 3 empties all of them with just a click. It finds all your Trash bins: external drive trashes, iPhoto trash, Mail trash, and other app-specific trashes â€” and then empties them all out. So tonight, itâ€™s your turn to take out the garbage. But luckily, all it takes is a click.  \r\n\r\nTrim gigabytes off your photo library â€” without losing a single picture:-\r\n\r\nItâ€™s not your photos that are wasting space, itâ€™s the hidden copies in your iPhoto library. You see, anytime you edit or rotate a photo, iPhoto creates a duplicate of the original and hide it for safe keeping. This means gigabytes of useless copies. CleanMyMac 3 cleans out all of them without harming any of your photos. \r\n\r\nWHATâ€™S NEW in Version 3.2.1:-\r\n\r\nâ€¢ Clean up leftover files of previous OS X versions as part of System Junk.\r\n\r\nBugs fixed:-\r\n\r\nâ€¢ Fixed an occasional problem of Photos not launching after cleanup.\r\nâ€¢ All known crashes and exceptions fixed.\r\n\r\nREQUIREMENTS:-\r\n\r\nâ€¢ OS X 10.8 or later, 64-bit processor","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f69a66ddbfd5ed1c63c6f5984a64f117760285d8","amp;dn":"CleanMyMac+v3.2.1+Mac+OS+X+%7BB4tman%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f69a66ddbfd5ed1c63c6f5984a64f117760285d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,154,102,221,191,213,237,28,99,198,245,152,74,100,241,23,118,2,133,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
