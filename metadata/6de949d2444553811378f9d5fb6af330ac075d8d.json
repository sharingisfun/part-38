It's always been freely available from the USACE ERDC labs, at the cost of one blank CD.  There's nothing &quot;sensitive&quot; about the software, and it's always been distributed by the Corps as a public resource.\n\nHowever, with a few recent changes in how the Corps has been handling its websites, this software has suddenly become hard to find through official channels.  I've had to provide it directly to several colleagues and contractors I've worked with in the last few months, rather than being able to refer them directly to the Corps for the latest copy.  This is the most recent copy I have available, which I obtained from ERDC in 2010.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6de949d2444553811378f9d5fb6af330ac075d8d","amp;dn":"USACE+CWALSHT+Retaining+Wall+Design","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6de949d2444553811378f9d5fb6af330ac075d8d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,233,73,210,68,69,83,129,19,120,249,213,251,106,243,48,172,7,93,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
