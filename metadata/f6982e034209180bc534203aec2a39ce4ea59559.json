A review of the files of the local policeman (John Bennett) shows that everyone who has owned the mansion has died in a horrible fashion. \nIn the first episode, &quot;Method for Murder,&quot; the obsessions of a mystery writer (Denholm Elliott) provide his wife with an opportunity to do him in. \nIn the second, &quot;Waxworks,&quot; Peter Cushing is the unhappy recipient of the attentions of a jealous husband. \nThe third, &quot;Sweets to the Sweet,&quot; has Christopher Lee fall victim to his charming little daughter, who plays with voodoo dolls. \nIn &quot;The Cloak,&quot; Jon Pertwee (best known for his TV portrayal of Dr. Who) is a horror-film star who insists on authenticity in his costumes. Somehow, he is given the cloak of a real vampire, with humorously ghoulish results.\n                \n\nPlease do not turn off torrent when you just downloaded.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f6982e034209180bc534203aec2a39ce4ea59559","amp;dn":"The+House+that+Dripped+Blood+%281971%29+-+DOM+WAMPIROW","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f6982e034209180bc534203aec2a39ce4ea59559","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,152,46,3,66,9,24,11,197,52,32,58,236,42,57,206,78,165,149,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
