It will give you information about the ongoing process in the floating text box. You may optionally hide that info-window, the scanning will continue. Easy WiFi Radar may find three possible types of access points, indicated by three colors:\n\nÃ‚ÂªGreen squares represent an open access point, not encrypted, with a strong signal. Easy WiFi Radar will try to connect to those first.\n\nYellow squares represent an open access point, not encrypted, but with a weak signal. Easy WiFi Radar will try to connect to those if it can&amp;#039;t connect to a green acces point..\n\nÃ‚ÂªRed squares represent a closed access point, encrypted with a WEP-key. Easy WiFi Radar will only try to connect to those if you provided a WEP-key in the Options Menu. If you provide an incorrect WEP-key, it will not be able to connect. Currently, Easy WiFi Radar does not support WPA-encryption or other forms of security.\n\nIf the radar finds an access point and connects to it, it will automatically try to request an IP-number from the access point. If it succesfully receives the IP-number, it will automatically test the connection. And if that test is positive, it will automatically open your webbrowser and connects to the internet. You will hear a sound effect to indicate a successfull connection.\n\nThe Radar will hide in the lower right corner of your screen (the so called &amp;#039; system tray icon&amp;#039;).\n\nIf it fails to connect properly, it will jump to the next strongest acces point and tries that one. And so on. Even while driving in your car, you may use Easy WiFi Radar to detect and connect to wireless access points.\n\n3.
