Where did they come from? And why? For some reason, someone, somewhere, thought history, fiction, poetry and the like weren't enough any more, and so they invented celebrity hardbacks, tragic lives and Dan Brown. Stewart takes a look at some of this new lavatory literature, including works by Asher D and Paddy McGinty's Goat, and finds out what would happen if Dan Brown got a job where he had to break bad news.\n\nStarring alongside Stewart are: Tony Law, Tara Flynn, Paul Putner, Kevin Eldon, Miles Jupp, Simon Munnery, Job Angus and Michael Redmond. Peter Serafinowicz provides the voiceover.\n\n\n                         Plus red button extra\n\n\nAfter each episode of Comedy Vehicle, Stewart will be called to account by the show's Executive Producer Armando Iannucci. It's The Frost/Nixon of comedy and if you think of Stewart as the driver of the comedy vehicle and the arguments as his wheels, then I suppose you can think of Armando as the man who can have Stewart sacked.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you dig it then seed the motherfucker you tight bastards, or as the FreakyFlicks tag so eloquently puts it\n\n'If we all seed just 1:1, give at least what we take, this torrent will NEVER DIE'\n\n\n\n\n\nPLEASE LEAVE YOUR COMMENTS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d99a1f865cf55d1a071d8a957249b361cba732e","amp;dn":"Stewart+Lees+Comedy+Vehicle+S01+E01+%2B+Extra","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d99a1f865cf55d1a071d8a957249b361cba732e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,153,161,248,101,207,85,209,160,113,216,169,87,36,155,54,28,186,115,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
