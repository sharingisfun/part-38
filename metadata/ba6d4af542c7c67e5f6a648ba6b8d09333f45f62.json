But mammals actually had their start long before the first dinosaurs - and they were as bizarre and mysterious as the dinosaurs themselves. Tale of a Sail examines the early dinosaur known as Dimetrodon, a hippo-sized beast that carried a sail on its back and proto-mammalian teeth in its mouth. Paleontologists debate the function of the sail, but not the fact that the Dimetrodon straddled the line between lizards--which went on to dominate the planet for millions of years--and mammals, which were reduced to rodent-sized prey until dinosaur extinction.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: Divx5\n * Video Bitrate: 1745 KB/s\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 4:3\n * Video Resolution: 720x544\n * Audio Codec: ac3\n * Audio BitRate: 192 KB/s\n * Audio Channels: 2 Ch\n * RunTime: 25 mins\n * Framerate: 25 FPS\n * Number Of Parts: 1\n * Part Size: 350mb\n * Encoded by: Doctor\n * Subtitles: NONE\n * Source: DVD\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Related Documentaries \n * http://docuwiki.net/?title=Walking%20with%20Beasts\n * http://docuwiki.net/?title=Walking%20with%20Dinosaurs\n\n2)  ed2k Links \n\ned2k://|file|Discovery.Paleoworld.Tale.of.a.Sail.DivX.AC3.DocDVDRip.avi|367470592|B0647D276084EC0E492BD2F214FAF4BB|h=UQUQ22WAN6TM7WZBNVTEEUVWJXKPV6R6|/\n\n\n\nAdded by http://docuwiki.net/?title=User%3AJumpinS\n\nSource: http://docuwiki.net/index.php?title=Tale_of_a_Sail\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba6d4af542c7c67e5f6a648ba6b8d09333f45f62","amp;dn":"DC+Paleoworld+-+Tale+of+a+Sail+%281994%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba6d4af542c7c67e5f6a648ba6b8d09333f45f62","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,109,74,245,66,199,198,126,95,106,100,139,166,184,208,147,51,244,95,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
