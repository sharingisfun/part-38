But since there seems to be\n a lot &quot;similarly&quot; &lt;cough&gt; named rips now I guess I should explain.\n I try to present the &quot;ultimate mastering&quot; of a particular LP, the &quot;mastering&quot; is not my equipment or process but the\n source material, it has always been about finding the best source. Now my opinion of the best source is subject to\n change as I experience more variations. Whether or not folks think my rip is &quot;definitive&quot; is irrelevant to me, I just\n try to find the best pressing and don't mind doing the extra clean up that comes with not just ripping new reissues or\n japanese issues. I understand the appeal of these pressings but I don't subscribe to the notion that they represent\n the best source 95% of the time.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80fc44c9270dc51b549932a0bd17f6f3d7710aab","amp;dn":"%5B24%2F96%5D+Nazareth+-+Greatest+Hits+-+1975%2C+Vinyl+Rip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80fc44c9270dc51b549932a0bd17f6f3d7710aab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,252,68,201,39,13,197,27,84,153,50,160,189,23,246,243,215,113,10,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
