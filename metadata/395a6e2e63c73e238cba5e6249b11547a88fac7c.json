This three part series uses dramatic reconstruction, expert analysis and the building of his machines, to bring the man and his dreams to life.\n\nWhile Leonardo is popularly regarded as an artist and inventor, the series highlights his work as an engineer, geologist, anatomist and even astronomer. Through the series we build and test five of Leonardo?s incredible designs - some for the very first time - a parachute, tank, scuba/snorkel, glider and robot. Incredibly, each design proves remarkably prescient.\n\nProgramme 1 -The Man Who Wanted To Know Everything\nExamines the first half of Leonardo&amp;#039;s life, from his birth near Florence to his famous achievements in the great cities of the Italian Renaissance. Studying his notebooks, and some of his most famous paintings and inventions, we discover there is far more to Leonardo than you may have thought.\n\nProgramme 2 - Dangerous Liaisions\nFor the second half of his biography, we find Leonardo in Venice. Here he experiments with his inventions - a diving suit and glider - which the team make and put to the test. We also see him mapmaking for the notorious Cesare Borgia.\n\nProgramme 3 - Mona Lisa\nCentred around Leonardo&amp;#039;s greatest masterpiece ? the most famous image in the history of art ? the Mona Lisa. How and why has it become so famous? The third programme of the series investigates the identity of this elusive woman.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:395a6e2e63c73e238cba5e6249b11547a88fac7c","amp;dn":"BBC+-+Leonardo+da+Vinci","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"395a6e2e63c73e238cba5e6249b11547a88fac7c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,90,110,46,99,199,62,35,140,186,94,98,73,177,21,71,168,143,172,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
