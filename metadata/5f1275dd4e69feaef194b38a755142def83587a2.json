Flavonoids are naturally occurring constituents of plants that have been traditionally used as anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer medicines. In addition, human consumption of vegetables and fruits with high concentrations of flavonoids is associated with decreased cancer mortalities rates.\r\n\r\nFlavonoids, Inflammation and Cancer presents an in-depth analysis of the mechanisms by which flavonoids are thought to prevent inflammation and the development of GI and steroid-responsive cancers. In addition, the promise and pitfalls associated with using flavonoids as chemopreventive agents are discussed.\r\n\r\nThis book is an invaluable reference for basic and clinical scientists who are interested in exploring the link between nutrition and cancer","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f1275dd4e69feaef194b38a755142def83587a2","amp;dn":"Flavonoids%2C+Inflammation+and+Cancer+-+Hollie+Swanson","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f1275dd4e69feaef194b38a755142def83587a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,18,117,221,78,105,254,174,241,148,179,138,117,81,66,222,248,53,135,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
