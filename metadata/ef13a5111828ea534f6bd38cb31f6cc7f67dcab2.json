The Buddies claimed a surprise 3-2 win over Celtic in the semi-finals to progress to this showpiece match, while Hearts triumphed over Inverness Caledonian Thistle via a penalty shoot-out after the match had finished 1-1 following extra time. Neither side has had much success in this competition, with Hearts last winning it in 1963 - their fourth overall victory - and St Mirren seeking a maiden success after finishing as runners-up on two previous occasions, most recently in 2010. With commentary by Liam McLeod and Billy Dodds, and analysis from Gordon Strachan, Jim Jeffries and Charlie Adam.\n\n\n\n\n2 hours 50 minutes\n\nMP4 - 720 x 480","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef13a5111828ea534f6bd38cb31f6cc7f67dcab2","amp;dn":"2013+Scottish+League+Cup+Final+St+Mirren+v+Hearts+%28BBC+Scotland%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef13a5111828ea534f6bd38cb31f6cc7f67dcab2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,19,165,17,24,40,234,83,79,107,211,140,179,31,108,199,246,125,202,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
