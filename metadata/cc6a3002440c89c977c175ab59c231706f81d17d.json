We are first shown various episodes of Tom's childhood with the corrupting influences of the beer hall, pool parlor, and false friends like minor-league fence Putty Nose. As young adults, Tom (James Cagney) and his pal, Matt Doyle (Edward Woods), are hired by ruthless but innately decent bootlegger Paddy Ryan (Robert Emmett O'Connor). The boys quickly rise to the top of the heap, with all the accoutrements of success: custom-tailored tuxedoes, fancy cars, and gorgeous girls. All the while, Tom's loving (and somewhat addlepated) mother (Beryl Mercer) is kept in the dark, believing Tommy to be a good boy, a fa?de easily seen through by his older brother Mike (Donald Cook). Tommy's degeneration from brash kid to vicious lowlife is brought home in a famous scene in which he smashes a grapefruit in the face of his latest mistress (Mae Clarke). Some dated elements aside, The Public Enemy is as powerful as when it was first released, and it is far superior to the like-vintage Little Caesar. James Cagney is so dynamic in his first starring role that he practically bursts off the screen; he makes the audience pull for a character with no redeeming qualities. The film is blessed with a superior supporting cast: Joan Blondell is somewhat wasted as Matt's girl, Mamie; Jean Harlow is better served as Tom's main squeeze, Gwen (though some of her line readings are a bit awkward); and Murray Kinnell is slime personified as the deceitful Putty Nose, who &quot;gets his&quot; in unforgettable fashion. Despite a tacked-on opening disclaimer, most of the characters in The Public Enemy are based on actual people, a fact not lost on audiences of the period. Current prints are struck from the 1949 reissue, which was shortened from 92 to 83 minutes (among the deletions was the character of real-life hoodlum Bugs Moran).\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i1140.photobucket.com/albums/n575/anchovyffrnc/Clipboard01-12.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i1140.photobucket.com/albums/n575/anchovyffrnc/Clipboard01-12.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i1140.photobucket.com/albums/n575/anchovyffrnc/Clipboard02-11.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i1140.photobucket.com/albums/n575/anchovyffrnc/Clipboard02-11.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i1140.photobucket.com/albums/n575/anchovyffrnc/Clipboard03-11.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i1140.photobucket.com/albums/n575/anchovyffrnc/Clipboard03-11.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i1140.photobucket.com/albums/n575/anchovyffrnc/Clipboard04-11.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i1140.photobucket.com/albums/n575/anchovyffrnc/Clipboard04-11.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i1140.photobucket.com/albums/n575/anchovyffrnc/Clipboard05-10.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i1140.photobucket.com/albums/n575/anchovyffrnc/Clipboard05-10.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n----------not my rip---------\n\nDVD extras appended to end of file\n\n~~~~~~ The Public Enemy.avi ~~~~~~                                     \n                                                               \nFile Size (in bytes):...........................1,564,194,816                     \n                                                                                \n--- Video Information ---                                                       \nVideo Codec Name:...............................XviD 1.2 SMP              \nDuration (hh:mm:ss):............................1:28:58                \nFrame Count:....................................127965             \nFrame Width (pixels):...........................640                  \nFrame Height (pixels):..........................480                  \nAspect Ratio:...................................1.333                     \nFrames Per Second:..............................23.976          \nVideo Bitrate (kbps):...........................2156                 \n......MPEG-4........................N-VOP......                    \nQuality Factor (bits/pixel)/frame:..............0.293&quot;                     \n                                                                                \n--- Audio Information ---                                                       \nAudio Codec:....................................0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3                   \nAudio Sample Rate (Hz):.........................48000             \nAudio Bitrate(kbps):............................192                 \nAudio Bitrate Type (&quot;CBR&quot; or &quot;VBR&quot;):............CBR            \nAudio Channel Count:............................1    \n\n*************************\n\n    Freakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
