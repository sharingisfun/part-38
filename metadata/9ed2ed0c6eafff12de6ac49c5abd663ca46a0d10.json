It was released on 14 December 1999, just over two years after Hutchence's death. Hutchence began work on what would become his posthumous solo album in 1995 with Gus Till and Mad Sheer Khan in Paris at Exit Studio. Following his death in 1997, Black Grape producer Danny Saber and ex-Gang of Four guitarist Andy Gill completed the album. U2 singer, and Hutchence's friend, Bono recorded lyrics which were added to the track &quot;Slide Away.&quot; The sole commercial singleÃ¢â‚¬â€&quot;A Straight Line&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€also included the B-side &quot;Standing on the Rooftop&quot; written by Gill and Hutchence and recorded during these sessions and the Max Q song &quot;The Passenger&quot;. The song &quot;Let the People Talk&quot; was also released digitally on the Internet. This album was simply dedicated to &quot;Tiger&quot; in reference to Hutchence's daughter, Heavenly Hiraani Tiger Lily Hutchence. The last song that Hutchence worked on before his death was &quot;Possibilities,&quot; which is track 2 on the album..\n\n\n\nCD - Track Listings\n\n[01] Let Me Show You\n[02] Possibilities\n[03] Get On The Inside\n[04] Fear\n[05] All I'm Saying\n[06] A Straight Line\n[07] Baby It's Alright\n[08] Don't Save Me From Myself\n[09] She Flirts For England\n[10] Flesh And Blood\n[11] Put The Pieces Back Together\n[12] Breathe\n[13] Slide Away - - - Michael Hutchence Featuring Bono\n\nCD Play Time - 00h:52m:43s\n\nTotal File Size....................... 129mb (Including MP3s + M3u, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat &amp; Bitrate..................
