It was also a pivotal year for America: the nation \nwas finding its groove, enjoying undreamt-of freedom and wealth social, racial and upheavals were \njust around the corner and jazz was ahead of the curve.\n\nFour major jazz albums were made, each a high watermark for the artists and a powerful reflection of \nthe times. Each opened up dramatic new possibilities for jazz which continue to be felt Miles Davis \nKind of Blue Dave Brubeck, Time Out Charles Mingus, Mingus Ah Um; and Ornette Coleman, The Shape of \nJazz to Come.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://nimga.com/m/E4o6D.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://nimga.com/m/E4o6D.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nRarely seen archive performances help vibrantly bring the era to life and explore what made these albums \nvital both in 1959 and the 50 years since.
