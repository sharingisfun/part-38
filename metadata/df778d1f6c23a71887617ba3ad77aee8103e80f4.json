Williams is the author if The Energy Non-Crisis.\n\nNot mentioned in the official show description, for the last half-hour of today's broadcast Alex talks in-studio with Ron Hubbard of Atlas Surviror Shelters.\nAlex apparently intends to join the elite in buying one of these. Hubbard said he's extremely busy, but that since Alex is &quot;special&quot; he could probably get one done for him by the end of the year.\nHubbard's website -- atlassurvivorshelters.com -- is currently unreachable.\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df778d1f6c23a71887617ba3ad77aee8103e80f4","amp;dn":"Alex+Jones+Show+-+2012+Oct+09+TU+%5Bsebaygo1%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df778d1f6c23a71887617ba3ad77aee8103e80f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,119,141,31,108,35,167,24,135,97,123,163,173,119,174,232,16,62,128,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
