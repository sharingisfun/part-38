The criminal organization connected to the Frankfort mafia has exiled Quarles to Kentucky. Quarles allies himself with local enforcer Wynn Duffy (Jere Burns) and begins to muscle in on the local criminals, successfully supplanting them until Raylan begins investigating. Quarles' efforts also bring him into conflict with Boyd's group resulting in the deaths of several local individuals. Simultaneously, Dickie Bennett, the lone survivor of the Bennett clan, seeks the aid of the black residents of Noble's Holler and their leader, Ellstin Limehouse (Mykelti Williamson), in recovering his inheritance. Limehouse attempts to keep his people out of the struggle between the criminal groups but becomes involved when Boyd gets the upper hand on Quarles, leading to a series of betrayals and deaths, some of which were sexual and deviant in nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tSeason 3 (2012)\r\n\r\n\r\n27 \t1 \t&quot;The Gunfighter&quot; \t \r\n28 \t2 \t&quot;Cut Ties&quot; \t \r\n29 \t3 \t&quot;Harlan Roulette&quot; \t \r\n30 \t4 \t&quot;The Devil You Know&quot;  \r\n31 \t5 \t&quot;Thick as Mud&quot; \tAdam Arkin \t  \t \r\n32 \t6 \t&quot;When the Guns Come Out&quot; \t \r\n33 \t7 \t&quot;The Man Behind the Curtain&quot; \t \r\n34 \t8 \t&quot;Watching the Detectives&quot; \t \r\n35 \t9 \t&quot;Loose Ends&quot; \t \r\n36 \t10 \t&quot;Guy Walks into a Bar&quot; \t \r\n37 \t11 \t&quot;Measures&quot; \t \r\n38 \t12 \t&quot;Coalition&quot;  \r\n39 \t13 \t&quot;Slaughterhouse&quot; \t\r\n\r\n\r\n April 10, 2012","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f2a60a1d6d4f9f1c66501e0caa65c0e809c0fe42","amp;dn":"Justified+-+Season+3+of+6","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f2a60a1d6d4f9f1c66501e0caa65c0e809c0fe42","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,166,10,29,109,79,159,28,102,80,30,12,170,101,192,232,9,192,254,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
