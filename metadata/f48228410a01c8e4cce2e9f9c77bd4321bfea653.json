Bonann (Creator of Baywatch) who also serves as Executive Producer, the series follows Southern CaliforniaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s elite multi-agency task force, Rescue 3, which consists of the cream-of-the-crop from Los Angeles Lifeguard, Firefighter and Coast Guard agencies. They are the heroes who answer the most challenging calls. Specialists who collaborate, coordinate, and initiate daring rescues in the most dangerous venues (air, fire, water) to save human life.\n\nEach episode will center on big-action rescues involving all three services lead by a reluctant leader, Lifeguard John Mathews, who has stepped in for his mentor and friend. The agency is the brainchild of Hal Dunnigan (MathewÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mentor) who dies heroically in the first episode saving a life.The inter-agency cooperative effort will not be without its challenges, but will provide for extremely dramatic personal conflict and still yield an effective and efficient public service. There is enormous competition between them as they uphold the pride of their individual services. BUT, when emergency life and death circumstances arise, they check their egos at the door and do whatever must be done to save human life, aware of the harsh reality that one of them, like Dunnigan, may not return.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f48228410a01c8e4cce2e9f9c77bd4321bfea653","amp;dn":"SAF3.S01E01.HDTV.x264-2HD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f48228410a01c8e4cce2e9f9c77bd4321bfea653","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,130,40,65,10,1,200,228,204,226,233,249,199,123,212,50,27,254,166,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
