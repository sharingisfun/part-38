Works great and so far, no problems.\n\nI have added extra content in the torrent that may not be needed by you.

The first one is not always the best\n\nContribute to the cause and help me by seeding.\n\n\nThanks,\nmags73","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f6d5fff27e1f7774962a1dbdf86ff6f1a119d96","amp;dn":"NovaMind+Platinum+4.6.2+with+%5BP%5Datcher+for+Mac+OS+X","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f6d5fff27e1f7774962a1dbdf86ff6f1a119d96","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,109,95,255,39,225,247,119,73,98,161,219,223,134,255,111,26,17,157,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
