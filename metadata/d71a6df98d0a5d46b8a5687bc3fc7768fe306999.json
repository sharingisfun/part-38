When a terminally-ill art historian meets an engineer, it is love and lust at first sight. But their love is threatened by her looming illness. With her remaining days on earth numbered, she chooses to fan the flames of her obsession by taking her lover on a trip to Venice, where the artist's work becomes the background for their physical passion and emotional discovery.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d71a6df98d0a5d46b8a5687bc3fc7768fe306999","amp;dn":"The+Garden+of+Earthly+Delights+2004+DVDRip+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d71a6df98d0a5d46b8a5687bc3fc7768fe306999","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,26,109,249,141,10,93,70,184,165,104,123,195,252,119,104,254,48,105,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
