Eighteen episodes were completed, but the series was canceled after only twelve had aired.\n\nA fan-led campaign persuaded NBC to broadcast three more episodes in July 2000; the three remaining unaired episodes were not seen until September of that year, when the cable network Fox Family Channel aired them in syndication. The complete series was later released on DVD.\n\nDespite a quick cancellation and only one season with 18 episodes, Freaks and Geeks developed a devoted cult following. The series appeared on Time magazine's 2007 &quot;100 Greatest Shows of All Time&quot; list, and in 2008 Entertainment Weekly ranked it the 13th-best series of the past 25 years.\n\nWeir family\n\n    * Linda Cardellini as Lindsay Weir\n    * John Francis Daley as Sam Weir\n    * Joe Flaherty as Harold Weir\n    * Becky Ann Baker as Jean Weir\n\nGeeks\n\n    * Samm Levine as Neal Schweiber\n    * Martin Starr as Bill Haverchuck\n    * Sarah Hagan as Millie Kentner\n    * Jerry Messing as Gordon Crisp\n    * Stephen Lea Sheppard as Harris Trinsky\n\nFreaks\n\n    * James Franco as Daniel Desario\n    * Busy Philipps as Kim Kelly\n    * Jason Segel as Nick Andopolis\n    * Seth Rogen as Ken Miller\n\nFaculty\n\n    * Dave &quot;Gruber&quot; Allen as Mr. Rosso\n    * Steve Bannos as Mr. Kowchevski\n    * Trace Beaulieu as Mr. Lacovara\n    * Steve Higgins as Mr. Fleck\n    * Leslie Mann as Ms. Foote\n    * Thomas F.

Sometimes they're added to \n    the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If you don't trust\n    the keygens, patches, cracks, etc., don't use them. \n    \n02- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks, etc., always check first \n    if they can be unpacked. Often some third party added a virus to the \n    original file, repacked it and uploaded it again.\n\n03- Letting anti-malware apps send scan results to their companies can cause\n    keygens, patches, cracks, etc., to be added to their virus-database.\n\n04- Firewalls which are set to automatically determine connections will allow \n    apps &amp; malware!. Avoid this by manually configuring your firewall.\n\n05- Usually (new) torrents with many downloads and seeders in a brief period is\n    suspicious! Torrents with the Skull &amp; Crossbones icon are trusted.\n\n06- Some people use multiple accounts and post fake comments \n    and/or files trying to spread confusion. They seldom seriously\n    comment or have any torrents, or a just a few to look passable.\n\n07- Clicking on unknown links can cause malware to be installed on your machine.\n  \n08- In general often there are more fake and negative comments than reliable and\n    positive comments.\n\n09- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright protected material is \n    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable up-loaders is not.\n\n10- Posting fake and negative comments or fake/infected uploads on TPB can result\n    in getting banned from TPB!\n\nRequests?
