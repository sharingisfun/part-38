This double-sized finale brings the Dark Reign to a shattering conclusion and brings with it the bombastic new HEROIC AGE. Every single page of this book is a shocker: Lives are changed. Heroes fall. Deaths. Revenge. Villain comeuppance. And when the dust settles, who will be in charge of the Marvel Universe?? You will find out here and only here. This is the one they will be talking about.\n\nThanks to the original scanners and uploader!! (Hope this is not considered as a duplicate post, cause it actually contains all the 5 covers released for Siege #4)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3ca02c77a24987e5f84a0d5b3b8c876cb068d56","amp;dn":"Siege+04+%28of+04%29+%282010%29+%285+covers%29+%28Minutemen-ThosTew+%26+Megan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3ca02c77a24987e5f84a0d5b3b8c876cb068d56","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,202,2,199,122,36,152,126,95,132,160,213,179,184,200,118,203,6,141,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
