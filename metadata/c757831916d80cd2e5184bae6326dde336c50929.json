This is the tale of Cardigan and CardiganÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s son, for in his chosen land the pioneer leader in the gigantic task of hewing a path for civilization was to know the bliss of womanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s love and of parenthood, and the sorrow that comes of the loss of a perfect mate; he was to know the tremendous joy of accomplishment and worldly success after infinite labour; and in the sunset of life he was to know the dull despair of failure and ruin. Because of these things there is a tale to be told, the tale of CardiganÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s son, who, when his sire fell in the fray, took up the fight to save his heritageÃ¢â‚¬â€œa tale of life with its love and hate, its battle, victory, defeat, labour, joy, and sorrow, a tale of that unconquerable spirit of youth which spurred Bryce Cardigan to lead a forlorn hope for the sake not of wealth but of an ideal.\n\nFrom: BitTorrentScene [BTScene]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c757831916d80cd2e5184bae6326dde336c50929","amp;dn":"The+Valley+of+the+Giants+by+Peter+B+Kyne+%5BrepublicV%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c757831916d80cd2e5184bae6326dde336c50929","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,87,131,25,22,216,12,210,229,24,75,174,99,38,221,227,54,197,9,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
