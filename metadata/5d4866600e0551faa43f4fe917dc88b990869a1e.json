They were an influential DIY political pop-punk band that toured the United States consistently and had one international tour. The band had a rotating roster of bassists and drummers, the last being Hannah Jones and Frankie Chan.\n\nThey broke up in 1999 after a few EPs and one full length.\n\nThe music of Operation: Cliff Clavin has been used extensively in the fourth season of Rox, which ironically began after the band had broken up.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d4866600e0551faa43f4fe917dc88b990869a1e","amp;dn":"Operation%3A+Cliff+Clavin+discography+DIY+punk+Fifteen+Crimpshrine","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d4866600e0551faa43f4fe917dc88b990869a1e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,72,102,96,14,5,81,250,164,63,79,233,23,220,136,185,144,134,154,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
