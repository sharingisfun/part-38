Nollet and Fidel Toldra (CRC, 2015).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 9781466556546\r\n\r\nUpdated to reflect changes in the industry during the last ten years, The Handbook of Food Analysis, Third Edition covers the new analysis systems, optimization of existing techniques, and automation and miniaturization methods. Under the editorial guidance of food science pioneer Leo M.L. Nollet and new editor Fidel Toldra, the chapters take an in-depth look at how to determine the chemical composition of foodstuffs at the level required to safeguard consumer health, well-being, and safety.\r\n\r\nSee Whatâ€™s New in the Third Edition:\r\n\r\nDiscussions of analysis techniques of rheological, thermal, and flavor properties of food\r\nExamination of methods and techniques in food analysis\r\nCoverage amines, flavorings, and food traceability\r\n\r\nUnparalleled in breadth and depth, the set delineates the physical and chemical properties of nutrients and other food components. It presents an exhaustive compilation of analytical methods and provides step-by-step descriptions of preparation, detection, separation, derivatization, and clean-up techniques. It also assesses the relative advantage, accuracy, and reliability of each procedure.\r\n\r\nVolume 1 covers Physical and Sensory Properties; Additives, Adulteration, and Traceability; and Nutritional Analysis while Volume 2 covers Residues and Other Food Components; as well as Methods, Techniques, and Instruments. Together the two volumes examine both parts of food analysis: analytical and quantitative testing of product composition and guaranteeing product quality and safety as productivity increases. These volumes give you the analytical foundation required to develop food products free from contaminants and toxins and the tools to control their safety","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c536304fef5b7db7add4e9c790d17cacab6323da","amp;dn":"Handbook+of+Food+Analysis+3rd+ed+%5B2+Vol.Set%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c536304fef5b7db7add4e9c790d17cacab6323da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,54,48,79,239,91,125,183,173,212,233,199,144,209,124,172,171,99,35,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
