But I don't hear one at all - check sample.\n\nBut then BB says there are &quot;fairly regular crackles&quot; on the Recorder 1/vinyl source. \n\nI don't hear them here either. \n\n...Maybe I am going deaf.\n\n[ -- &quot;You didn't have to live and die like my old man did, working in some factory till he couldn't hear what you were saying to him anymore.&quot; \n\n -- Point taken, Bruce. My father just chose to live and die without ever hearing me. Besides it was 16 Tons of live Clash that enflamed my eardrums till I was on fire forever.]\n\n\n- &quot;Follow That Dream Revisited&quot; is reported to be remastered in 2002 from a previously unplayed vinyl copy of the bootleg, Follow That Dream. \n\nThe Recorder 1 mastertapes were destroyed during a fire in the mid-80's. (See info in booklet included.)\n\n\n[Back in the daze my ex-wife made me sell my dream lp copy along with lots of other vinyl boots like roses in the rain. ...Fuck me... She wouldn't.]\n \n\n- Besides being a simply amazing performance by the man and the band, this source is by far the best-sounding River show I know, that I believe more than any other gets the job done. \n\n\nSeven Days In May - MAY 7 - HAPPY FESTA OF ST. NICOLA!\n\n...in Bari, Italy, celebrates the transfer of his relics to Bari. Religious rites followed by spectacular fireworks displays, honor this patron of orphans, pirates, etc.\n\n\n -- &quot;The only thing when I was young that kept me from giving up, was that in the rock and roll music that I heard, there was promise that there was a meaning in life, a meaning in living.&quot; \n\n -- Revisit Follow That Dream Revisited.\n\n&quot;It's like the whole world's walking pretty.&quot;\n_____________________________________________\n\nCover Samples:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Torrent/1981-05-07FollowThatDreamRevisitedFront.jpg~original&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Torrent/1981-05-07FollowThatDreamRevisitedFront.jpg~original&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Torrent/1981-05-07FollowThatDreamRevisitedBooklet2.jpg~original&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Torrent/1981-05-07FollowThatDreamRevisitedBooklet2.jpg~original&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd401e3b70eaedf4887a81f85649b50eee73de9a","amp;dn":"Bruce+Springsteen+-+1981-05-07+Follow+That+Dream+Revisited+%28live","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd401e3b70eaedf4887a81f85649b50eee73de9a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,64,30,59,112,234,237,244,136,122,129,248,86,73,181,14,238,115,222,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
