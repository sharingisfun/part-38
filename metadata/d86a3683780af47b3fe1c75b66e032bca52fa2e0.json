Why do threats such as the Gulf oil spill, worldwide recession, terrorism, and global warming suddenly seem unstoppable? Are there limits to the kinds of problems humans can solve?\n\nRebecca Costa confronts- and offers a solution to-these questions in her highly anticipated and game-changing book, The WatchmanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Rattle.\n\nCosta pulls headline for todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s news to demonstrate how accelerating complexity quickly outpaces that rate at which the human brain can develop new capabilities. With compelling evidenced based on research in the rise and fall of Mayan, Khmer, and Roman empires, Costa shows how t ht tendency to find a quick solutions- leads to frightening long term consequence: SocietyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ability to solve its most challenging, intractable problems becomes gridlocked, progress slows, and collapse ensues.\n\nA provocative new voice in the tradition of thought leaders Thomas Friedman, Jared Diamond and Malcolm Gladwell, Costa reveals how we can reverse the downward spiral. Part history, part social science, part biology, The WatchmanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Rattle is sure to provoke, engage and incite change.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d86a3683780af47b3fe1c75b66e032bca52fa2e0","amp;dn":"The+Watchman%27s+Rattle%3A+Thinking+Our+Way+Out+of+Extinction","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d86a3683780af47b3fe1c75b66e032bca52fa2e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,106,54,131,120,10,244,123,63,225,199,91,102,224,50,188,165,47,162,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
