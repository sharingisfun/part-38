So her editor hands her a challenge: She can cover any topic she wants, but only if she first scores the paper an interview with Finn Dalton, the notoriously reclusive author.\n \nLiving in the remote Alaskan wilderness, Finn has written a megabestselling memoir about surviving in the wild. But he stubbornly declines to speak to anyone in the press, and no one even knows exactly where he lives.\n \nDigging deep into FinnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s past, Carrie develops a theory on his whereabouts. It is the holidays, but her career is at stake, so she forsakes her family celebrations and flies out to snowy Alaska. When she finally finds Finn, she discovers a man both more charismatic and more stubborn than she even expected. And soon she is torn between pursuing the story of a lifetime and following her heart.\n \nFilled with all the comforts and joys of Christmastime, Starry Night is a delightful novel of finding happiness in the most surprising places.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a41cac2bbf9246f23c3d41d9634f43e4bc29143a","amp;dn":"Starry+Night+-+Debbie+Macomber","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a41cac2bbf9246f23c3d41d9634f43e4bc29143a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,28,172,43,191,146,70,242,60,61,65,217,99,79,67,228,188,41,20,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
