TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re silly. TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re healthy. TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re clever. TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re artistic. TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re delicious. TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re fun. TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re a great way to start the day. One breakfast at a time, Bill and Claire Wurtzel are determined to make you laugh and eat and play and laugh some more. Riffing over the years with oatmeal, eggs, apples, and nuts, it is finally ours to shareÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Funny Food!\nNot since Joost ElffersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Play With Your Food has food been so ridiculous and so endlessly diverting. Parents and children will giggle through breakfast. Teachers and students can laugh some more making snacks or desserts after lunch. This is a book filled with nothing but engaging spontaneity and simplicity that makes you say, Ã¢â‚¬Å“I can do that.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ And, you can...the consequences are yummy.\nThese are not your motherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s smiley-face sandwiches. In BillÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s world, carrots turn into airplanes; boiled eggs into jugglers, and pears into guitar players. As gracefully as PicassoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ceramic plates found endless form so do WurtzelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s portraits, which seem to grow out of almost anythingÃ¢â‚¬â€cheerios and bananas; lox and bagels; oatmeal, blueberries, and strawberries. Sometimes you think he is portrait artist and you could swear you just saw Sigmund Freud emerging from a pear or Shakespeare growing out of an apple. Sometimes the plates are just plain fanciful. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Your breakfasts donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have to look like theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll hang in the Louvre,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ he says. Ã¢â‚¬Å“ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the gesture that counts.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ But it sure looks like he riffed on MatisseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s paper cutout dancers with a papaya.\n\nAbout the Authors\nFor decades, Bill Wurtzel worked in advertising by day and moonlighted as a guitarist in big bands.
