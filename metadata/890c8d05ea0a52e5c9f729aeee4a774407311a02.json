This is typically Tyr: the whole album is very      ?\n            ?  grounded and instrumentally edgy, at the same time  ?\n            ?  rhythmically powerful and majestically pumping.     ?\n            ?  This is exactly the way, the Faroese Viking         ?\n            ?  Metal-heroes return with their fourth album,        ?\n            ?  simply entitled &quot;Land&quot;, featuring a collection of   ?\n            ?  Icelandic and Norwegian traditionals. Old folk      ?\n            ?  tunes that were edgily and powerfully arranged for  ?\n            ?  this very positively sounding album. And with       ?\n            ?  them, the historically interested quartet present   ?\n            ?  themselves not too far away from the loveliest      ?\n            ?  Humppa-songs that we have come to know. Vocally,    ?\n            ?  they have done quite some work, here, making        ?\n            ?  &quot;Land&quot; the most mature album to date ÃƒÂ» and that     ?\n            ?  also refers to the many dual vocal lines. If you    ?\n            ?  know the last records of Tyr well the first thing   ?\n            ?  that will be striking for you is the great          ?\n            ?  production of the new album. The legendary Jacob    ?\n            ?  Hansen has really done a good job here.             ?\n            ?                                                      ?\n            ?
