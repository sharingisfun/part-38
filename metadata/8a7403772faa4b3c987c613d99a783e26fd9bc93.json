So, we just hacked an FBI affiliated website \n(Infragard, specifically the Atlanta chapter) and leaked its user base. We also took \ncomplete control over the site and defaced it, check it out if it's still up: http://infragardatlanta.org/\n\nWhile not very many logins (around 180), we'd like to take the time to point out that all \nof them are affiliated with the FBI in some way. Most of them reuse their passwords in other places, \nwhich is heavily frowned upon in the FBI/Infragard handbook and generally everywhere else too.\n\nOne of them, Karim Hijazi, used his Infragard password for his personal gmail, and the gmail of \nthe company he owns. &quot;Unveillance&quot;, a whitehat company that specializes in data breaches and botnets, \nwas compromised because of Karim's incompetence. We stole all of his personal emails and his company \nemails. We also briefly took over, among other things, their servers and their botnet control panel.\n\nAfter doing so, we contacted Karim and told him what we did. After a few discussions, he offered to \npay us to eliminate his competitors through illegal hacking means in return for our silence. Karim, \na member of an FBI-related website, was willing to give us money and inside info in order to destroy \nhis opponents in the whitehat world. We even discussed plans for him to give us insider botnet information.\n\nNaturally we were just stringing him along to further expose the corruption of whitehats. \nPlease find enclosed Karim's full contact details and a log of him talking to us through IRC. \nAlso, enjoy 924 of his internal company emails - we have his personal gmail too, unreleased.\n\nWe call upon journalists and other writers to delve through the emails carefully, as we have \nuncovered an operation orchestrated by Unveillance and others to control and assess Libyan \ncyberspace through malicious means: the U.S. government is funding the CSFI to attack Libya's \ncyber infrastructure. You will find the emails of all 23 people involved in the emails.\n\nUnveillance was also involved in a scheme where they paid an Indian registrar $2000 to \nreceive 100 domains a month that may be deemed as botnet C&amp;Cs. Shameful ploys by supposed &quot;whitehats&quot;.\n\nWe accept your threats, NATO. Game on, losers.\n\nNow we are all sons of bitches,\n\nLulz Security\n\n---\n\nHow to open the lulzy emails:\n- Sail over here: http://www.mozillamessaging.com/thunderbird/\n- Get this thing that changes filetypes: http://www.bulkrenameutility.co.uk/Download.php\n- Grab your booty (the email files) and change their extension to &quot;.eml&quot; using the above tool\n- copy/drag into your Thunderbird sailing vessel\n\nHappy plundering!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a7403772faa4b3c987c613d99a783e26fd9bc93","amp;dn":"Fuck+FBI+Friday%C3%A2%E2%80%9E%C2%A2+%28FFF%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a7403772faa4b3c987c613d99a783e26fd9bc93","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,116,3,119,47,170,75,60,152,124,97,61,153,167,131,226,111,217,188,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
