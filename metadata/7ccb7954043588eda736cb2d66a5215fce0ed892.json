Collection\nfocuses on M-Pac!, the blues and hard soul imprint of\nthis legendary R&amp;B label group. M-Pac! is preceded by\nthe One-derful! and Mar-V-Lus compilations and will be\nfollowed by releases of the Halo, Midas, and Toddlin'\nTown sub-labels. This series marks the first in-depth\nstudy of what was once one of Chicago's most prominent\nAfrican-American run labels.\n\nCentral to M-Pac! is the Leaner family. By 1963 when\nbrothers George and Ernie Leaner added M-Pac! as a\nsub-label to their One-derful! label, they were\nrevered figures on Chicago's Record Row and beyond.\nThey distributed material from labels like Motown and\nStax and they attracted top talent. It wasn't uncommon\nfor a WVON DJ to help the Leaners sign their newest\ndiscovery, or for their singers, musicians,\nsongwriters, or producers to have Chess or Motown on\ntheir resumes.\n\nNearly 20 years prior, George and Ernie started work\nat their sister's Groove Record Shop. Before long,\nGeorge was an assistant to legendary blues producer\nLester Melrose, and later the brothers helped run\nParkway Records - recording historic 78s featuring\nLittle Walter and Muddy Waters. They did all of this\nbefore launching United Record Distributors in 1950 -\nregarded as the nation's first black owned record\ndistributor. In addition, their uncle Al Benson was\nthe most influential Radio DJ on Chicago's South Side.\nHis on-air support and occasional partnerships with\nthe Chess brothers proved crucial to their early\nsuccess. He also helped many DJs get their start,\nincluding Vivian Carter who later formed Vee-Jay\nRecords. In fact, United Record Distributors hosted\nher wedding. The Leaner name also turns up in\nconnection with many of the greats in blues and soul:\nGeorge Leaner produced an early release for Berry\nGordy's Tamla label, and in the 1970s Ernie Leaner and\nStax's Al Bell partnered to form Ernie's Onestop and a\nchain of Record World stores. The Leaner family were\namong the most important black businessmen of music's\ngolden era, yet much of their history has only been\nsuperficially documented until now.\n\nBetween 1962 and 1971, the One-derful! family of\nlabels released 180+ 45s of stunning soul, funk, and\ngospel. Over two years of painstaking research and\nwork, including countless hours spent cataloging,\ntransferring, and mastering 250 of the label's tapes,\nhas contributed to an amazingly extensive reissue\ncollection. In addition, some of the world's leading\nexperts have contributed liner notes and interviewed\nvirtually every known surviving artist, producer, and\notherwise involved party. In total, the six volumes of\nthe One-derful! Collection include 12 LPs/6 CDs with\n147 tracks, 57 which were never issued, and 144 pages\nof 12&quot; x 12&quot; liner notes stuffed full of rare and\nnever before seen photos and memorabilia. Spanning\n1962 to 1971, these compilations bring forth a wealth\nof overlooked and never before heard recordings and\nhistory.\n\nUnreleased Tracks:\n\n3,4,6,9,11,12,13,15,17,21.\n\nd a t a\n\n#    t r a c k  n a m e                         t i m e\n\n01-  Willie Parker - I Live The Life I Love     [02:40]\n02-  The Accents - New Girl                     [02:03]\n03-  The Ringleaders - All of My Life           [02:27]\n04-  Harold Burrage - Bad Situation             [02:46]\n05-  Dorothy Prince - Hey Mister                [03:25]\n06-  Andrew Tibbs - Change of Heart             [02:48]\n07-  Bobby Davis - Damper Down                  [02:04]\n08-  Maurice Dollison and The Turnkeys - The    [02:44]\n     Earth Worm (Part 1)\n09-  Willie Parker - Let Me Make It Up To You   [02:49]\n10-  Harold Burrage - Things Ain't What They    [03:20]\n     Used To Be (Since You've Been Gone)\n11-  The Ringleaders - I'd Like To Win You Over [02:20]\n12-  Benny Turner - Angel                       [02:30]\n13-  Harold Burrage - Mountain of Soul          [02:52]\n14-  Stacy Johnson - I Stand Alone              [02:56]\n15-  Willie Parker - Never In A Million Years   [03:10]\n16-  The Ringleaders - Baby, What Has Happened  [02:25]\n     To Our Love\n17-  Big Daddy Simpson - Lonely Man             [03:11]\n18-  The Accents - Do You Need A Good Man       [02:22]\n19-  Stacy Johnson - Don't Try To Fool Me       [03:02]\n20-  Harold Burrage - Got To Find A Way         [03:52]\n     (Extended Version)\n21-  Willie Parker - So Glad                    [02:10]\n22-  Benny Turner - Come Back Home              [02:51]\n23-  The Ringleaders - Let's Start Over         [03:20]\n24-  Dorothy Prince - Every Night               [02:32]\n\n88,4 m e g s                   t o t a l  [66:39]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ccb7954043588eda736cb2d66a5215fce0ed892","amp;dn":"VA-The_One-Derful_Collection_Vol_3_M-Pac_Records-2015-CMS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ccb7954043588eda736cb2d66a5215fce0ed892","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,203,121,84,4,53,136,237,167,54,203,45,102,165,33,95,206,14,216,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
