The Classic Motorist's Way.\nDavid Heathcote uses two of the earliest Shell Guides to explore modern-day Britain. The 1930s Shell Guide to Dorset was compiled by Paul Nash, a leading contemporary war artist, while the Guide to Cornwall was edited by the young, ambitious John Betjeman. As he travels, Heathcote explores themes of development which the Guides raise. Betjeman declared that traffic had spoilt everything by the 1960s, but Heathcote discovers a more optimistic view of the changes in Cornwall.\n\nBBC Site &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00hw3yr&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00hw3yr&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTechnical Spec\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC\nVideo Bitrate: 4000 Kbps\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.777:1\nVideo Resolution: 1280x720\nAudio Codec: AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192 Kbps CBR 48KHz\nAudio Channels: 2\nRun-Time: 59mins\nFramerate: 25FPS\nNumber of Parts: 2\nPart Size: 1.72 GB\nSubtitles: merged\nSource: HDTV\n\nSRT available from MVGroup\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ff7106ac5aea7c8ea3ec1b0b94188499d8a2657","amp;dn":"BBC+Touring+Britain+2of2+HDTV+x264+AC3+MVGroup+2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ff7106ac5aea7c8ea3ec1b0b94188499d8a2657","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,247,16,106,197,174,167,200,234,62,193,176,185,65,136,73,157,138,38,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
