This book provides an overview of the cinemas of these regions, interpreting some of the recent developments as strategic responses to globalisation. Highlighting transnational and cross-cultural structures, influences and themes, it offers:* A broad critical context for the study of contemporary world cinema, introducing key concepts and issues including modes of production and distribution.* Cultural and historical background for the cinemas of each region, with analyses of regional aesthetic styles and comparisons with Hollywood models.* Case studies of Scandinavian, Iranian, Hong Kong and Indian cinema.* Close analysis of twelve landmark films, including Thomas Vinterberg's Festen, Samira Makhmalbaf's The Apple, Wong Kar-Wai's In the Mood For Love, and Ashutosh Gowariker's Lagaan.Contemp\n\nPublisher: Edinburgh University Press (May 4, 2005)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 074861799X\nISBN-13: 978-0748617999\n\nEditorial Reviews\nReview\nChaudhuri's thinking is clean, complex, important, scholarly, and informed !
