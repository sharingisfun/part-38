During the War of 1812, the Royal Navy and United States Navy squared off in a number of such duels, the most famous between the USS Constitution and HMS GuerriÃƒÂ¨re. Tactics between the two nations varied enormously, with the American Navy favoring twenty-four pound guns, heavy carronades, and larger crews, while the British tended to equip its frigates with eighteen-pound guns and smaller, more economical crews. Through first-hand accounts of officers and sailors present at the battles and fascinating comparisons of artillery, crew ability and tactical achievements, this book offers an unparalleled insight into the ruthless reality of frigate battles in the War of 1812","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:941a976f8a5209d50a2c4e0a5206028b883a9cc0","amp;dn":"Constitution+vs+Guerriere%3A+Frigates+During+the+War+of+1812","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"941a976f8a5209d50a2c4e0a5206028b883a9cc0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,26,151,111,138,82,9,213,10,44,78,10,82,6,2,139,136,58,156,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
