This record will cost you up to $40.00 on Ebay plus airmail postage from the EU (if you can find it). \n\nMost all of Side 1 is previously released and included on the Have You Got It Yet? 1.0 version. Much of Side 2 is previously unreleased and unheard material from the David Bowie sponsored 1973 sessions. No lead guitar or vocal tracks were ever recorded for these sessions. Two versions of the Kevin Ayers song are on this release. For you Puritans, the second version is the one that is actually on the LP, but due to misidentification on the original Kevin Ayers CD, it is not the version of the song that actually has Syd. Although it sounds better, it only has Kevin Ayers sounding very Syd-like. For you Syd fans, the FIRST version of the song on this torrent is the one believed by Laughing Madcaps cognoscenti to have Syd-- you can hear him mixed down in the right channel. \n\noriginal LP -&gt; turntable -&gt; preamp -&gt; Apple PowerBook -&gt; Audacity (sampled at 24?-bit/96khz) -&gt; ClickRepair (very light) -&gt; xAct (Flac files) -&gt; mailed data DVD-R -&gt; FlacFrontEnd -&gt; WAV -&gt; Cool Edit Pro (convert 32-bit/96kHz to 16-bit/44.1kHz) -&gt; WAV -&gt; FlacfrontEnd 6 (no SBE)\n\n\n01.
