After Mercury's death in November 1991, Deacon, Roger Taylor and Brian May worked with vocals and piano parts that Mercury recorded before his death, along with newly recorded lyrics by the remaining band members.\n\nBoth stages of recording, before and after Mercury's death, were completed at the band's studio in Montreux, Switzerland. The album debuted at No. 1 in the UK where it went 4x platinum.
