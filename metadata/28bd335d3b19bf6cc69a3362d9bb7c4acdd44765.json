Corral-And How It Changed the American West\n\nUnabridged; 96 kbps, Read by Stephen Hoye\n\nOverview\nOn the afternoon of October 26, 1881, in a vacant lot in Tombstone, Arizona, a confrontation between eight armed men erupted in a deadly shootout. The Gunfight at the O.K. Corral would shape how future generations came to view the Old West. Wyatt Earp, Doc Holliday, and the Clantons became the stuff of legends, symbolic of a frontier populated by good guys in white hats and villains in black ones. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a colorful storyÃ¢â‚¬â€but the truth is even better.\n\nDrawing on new material from private collectionsÃ¢â‚¬â€including diaries, letters, and Wyatt EarpÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own hand-drawn sketch of the shootoutÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s conclusionÃ¢â‚¬â€as well as archival research, Jeff Guinn gives us a startlingly different and far more fascinating picture of what actually happened that day in Tombstone and why.\n\nPublishers Weekly\nThere are no black and white hats in this gripping revisionist account of the famed 1881 showdown. There are only mixed motives, murky schemes, and misguided hotheads. Historian Guinn (Go Down Together: The True, Untold Story of Bonnie and Clyde) uncovers complex figures who straddle the line between outlaw and lawman: Wyatt Earp, he reveals, was an impetuous gambling impresario and possibly an ex-pimp whose unprovoked bullying helped spark the confrontation, while Doc Holliday was an unstable cardsharp prone to settling minor differences with gunplay. Guinn sets the story in a Tombstone, Ariz., that's a Wild West version of The Wire, complete with seething political intriguesÃ¢â‚¬â€what Earp was mainly gunning for was a post as county sheriff and its lucrative tax-collecting franchiseÃ¢â‚¬â€and a cowboy culture synonymous with thuggery and deeply entrenched in a semilicit cattle-rustling economy. As Guinn's exhaustively researched, stylishly written narrative untangles the personal feuds and social pressures, he explodes many of the Manichaean myths surrounding the gunfight. He replaces them with something as grimly compelling as a Greek tragedy: a tale of proud men drawnÃ¢â‚¬â€almost against their willÃ¢â‚¬â€toward bloodshed.\n\nKirkus Reviews\nAn absorbing, meticulous account of the famous O.K. Corral gunfight as it really happened.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:28bd335d3b19bf6cc69a3362d9bb7c4acdd44765","amp;dn":"Jeff+Guinn+-+The+Last+Gunfight+%5B96%5D+Unabridged","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"28bd335d3b19bf6cc69a3362d9bb7c4acdd44765","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,189,51,93,59,25,191,108,198,154,51,98,217,187,124,74,205,212,71,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
