I don't know whether they actually released a physical album, I just converted the videos into mp3s from Youtube and added the metadata. All the songs seem to have been recorded together, and in 2011 I think.\n\nFrom musicnovascotia.ca:\n\n&quot; From the journal of Dr. G. Funksmith, 2011: &quot;For days now I've debated putting on paper what I've seen. If anyone reads this, they will surely think I'm mad. But I am not mad! It's the world that's mad, and that's why I must do what I do.... Days ago, late at night, I had an... encounter.... with an extraterrestrial being. I was taken from my home to his spacecraft. This 'Mysterious Man' (which I call him for convenience's sake only, for he was not a man, nor, perhaps, even a 'he') performed tests on me, the nature of which I will not discuss. Suffice to say I will never be the same! But the Mysterious Man also conveyed a message to me... A message of the gravest importance. He said he had detected what he called 'The Funk' upon our world, and came to investigate, thinking he had discovered some advanced society. But instead, he found a primitive people on the verge of self-annihilation! And he gave me this message. He said: 'Unless your people can groove to the Cosmic Sound and get in tune with the Universal Consciousness, you will not survive.' And so I was returned to my home. I began, feverishly, to study The Funk and those among us who bring it to the people. And I realized that I must aid them. I must help bring The Funk to the people. I only hope that it is not too late....&quot; &quot;\n\nBAND MEMBERS: \t\nGreg Melchin\nBrendan Melchin\nJames Spray\nJenny MacDonald\nRoss Avey\nPeter Bull\nChristian Dufault\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.musicnovascotia.ca/unidentifiedfunkobject&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.musicnovascotia.ca/unidentifiedfunkobject&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2fec65c736b1a220043543898dc5f147c28d6cdc","amp;dn":"Unidentified+Funk+Object","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2fec65c736b1a220043543898dc5f147c28d6cdc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,236,101,199,54,177,162,32,4,53,67,137,141,197,241,71,194,141,108,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
