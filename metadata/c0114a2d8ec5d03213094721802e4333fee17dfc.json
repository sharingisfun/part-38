Almost all areas of unit formation and war history have been covered. Scarcely a military theme since World War I has been omittedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½with one exception. On uniforms, a very basic theme of military life, there is little literature in German. Several treatments have included the uniforms of the Reichswehr, those of the Wehrmacht and the uniform history of the Bundeswehr. In the USA, Great Britain and France, on the other hand, there is much on the subject. With the series &quot;German Uniforms of the 20th Century&quot;, this gap literature is now filled. We begin with the uniforms of the panzer troops. The limitation of one service arm per volume, but coveri ng the time from World War I to the present, is especially fascinating. In this manner, lines of development in the uniforming of one type of unit, or breaks in the tradition, are easy to see. Such relationships are made clear to the reader in this new information on uniforms, with the emphasis on pictorial presentation. Unpublished illustrations of collection pieces and contemporary photographic material with clear references to people and times, are outstanding elements of these books.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c0114a2d8ec5d03213094721802e4333fee17dfc","amp;dn":"+Uniforms+of+the+Panzer+Troops+1917+to+the+Present+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c0114a2d8ec5d03213094721802e4333fee17dfc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,17,74,45,142,197,208,50,19,9,71,33,128,46,67,51,254,225,125,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
