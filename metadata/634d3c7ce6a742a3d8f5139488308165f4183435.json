Using WainwrightÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Pictorial Guides to the Lakeland Fells, Julia discovers the treasures of the Lake District.\n\nIn this series we follow Julia on six of WainwrightÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s walks as she tackles; Helvellyn via Striding Edge, one of the Lake's most famous challenges; ascends the 'perfect family' fell Catbells; and succeeds in conquering Wainwright's 'best ridge mile' and two peaks in one day, Crinkle Crags and Bowfell.\n\nShe also surmounts the true summit of Helm Crag which Wainwright himself never succeeded in reaching: learns of the sadness of Mardale while climbing High Street encountering its many twists and turns; and experiences the drama of what Wainwright called the most handsome crag in Lakeland, Pillar.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:634d3c7ce6a742a3d8f5139488308165f4183435","amp;dn":"Wainwright+Walks+-+Season+2+Complete+++%28BBC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"634d3c7ce6a742a3d8f5139488308165f4183435","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,77,60,124,230,167,66,163,216,245,19,148,136,48,129,101,244,24,52,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
