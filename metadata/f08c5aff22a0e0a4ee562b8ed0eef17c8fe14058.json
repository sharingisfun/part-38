It has been a year since Crimeans took to the polls to vote for returning to \n\ntheir Motherland and leaving wretched Ukraine behind. The Western powers - led, as ever, by the US and UK - are \n\ndetermined to portray this momentous historic event as an imperial land-grab by Russia, and that it caused the \n\nsubsequent civil war between Kiev and the breakaway provinces in the country's East.\n\nHowever, as this excellent documentary shows, the Russian government could see that the violent manner in which \n\nthe elected Ukrainian leader Yanukovich had been ousted from power - with American fingerprints all over it - \n\nmeant chaos would soon spread throughout Ukraine, and that the majority ethnic Russian population in Crimea would \n\nbe among the worst hit by neo-Nazi militias terrorizing anyone whom they considered 'insufficiently loyal' to the \n\nUS-selected regime. When President Yanukovich fled the capital on February 22nd 2014, President Putin set in \n\nmotion a series of responses that would present the first real (and successful) challenge to American imperial \n\nhegemony.\n\nIn this must-watch documentary, you'll learn:\n\n    how Russia saved President Yanukovich of Ukraine\n    how Crimeans returning from revolution in Kiev tasted the the rage of the Right Sektor 'Maidan orcs'\n    how members of the Berkut police force escaped to Crimea and helped set up people's militias to defend the \n\npeninsula, not least by preventing Kiev military jets from landing at Sevastopol's airport\n    how these civilian militias defended against an organized takeover of the Crimean Parliament in Sevastopol\n    that most Crimean Tatars sided with the ethnic Russian population, despite efforts by the coup organizers to \n\ngenerate an ethnic split between them\n    how the militias came together to blockade repeated efforts by the 'Maidan orcs' (Right Sektor fascists) to \n\nenter the peninsula - by road, train and air\n    how the Crimean Referendum was enacted following near unanimous support from the people's representatives in \n\nthe Crimean Parliament\n    how Berkut forces were joined by Kuban Cossacks from across the Black Sea region, including veterans of \n\nRussia's Afghan War, to defend Crimea from efforts by the new regime to send in weapons and explosives\n    how, having prevented Kiev from deploying 'Maidan orcs' via air, rail and road, Russia's Black Sea Fleet \n\nblockaded the Ukrainian navy from leaving its home port\n    how the Russian military placed the brand new Coastal Defence System 'Bastion-P' at locations along Crimea's \n\nsouthern coast. Once activated, the approaching USS Donald Cook Destroyer turned around at full-speed before \n\nRussian military jets chased the American warship south\n    how the 'Night Wolves' biker gang joined in the defence of Crimea in Yalta by kidnapping Ukrainian General \n\nMikhail Koval and uncovering weapons caches left by the Ukies prior to the coup\n    how the Crimean citizen militias and Russian soldiers stationed in Sevastopol peacefully neutralized 20,000 \n\nUkrainian forces stationed on the peninsula, many of whom then defected to Russia","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f08c5aff22a0e0a4ee562b8ed0eef17c8fe14058","amp;dn":"%D0%9A%D1%80%D1%8B%D0%BC.+%D0%9F%D1%83%D1%82%D1%8C+%D0%BD%D0%B0+%D0%A0%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%B8%D0%BD%D1%83++%2F+Crimea.+The+way+home.+English+subtitles.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f08c5aff22a0e0a4ee562b8ed0eef17c8fe14058","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,140,90,255,34,160,224,164,238,86,43,142,208,238,241,124,143,225,64,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
