These are rips from the Leave It To Beaver Shout! Factory set. The bonus features were of bad quality except for the pilot episode. I put the pilot episode in with the first season. I used Handbrake for the rips and an app called iFlicks to get the cover art for each file. Sorry if some of you are looking for bigger and better quality files but I took into account some peoples bandwidth. Also, I don't think too many people are watching them on 50&quot;+ TVs. Me, I mostly catch up watching shows on my iPad. Enjoy!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:93c171d602b84b90cb64c0690e79a091fef088e8","amp;dn":"LEAVE+IT+TO+BEAVER","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"93c171d602b84b90cb64c0690e79a091fef088e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,193,113,214,2,184,75,144,203,100,192,105,14,121,160,145,254,240,136,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
