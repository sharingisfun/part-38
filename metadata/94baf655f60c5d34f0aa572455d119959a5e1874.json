The main character, Sheriff Wade Parent (James Brolin), is on a mission to stop the car which seems to have a demonic driver. The police officers chase the automobile down highways throughout the desert, but it destroys several squad cars before injuring Wade and then mysteriously disappears.\n\nThe hunt for the car becomes a personal vendetta when the automobile eliminates Wade's girlfriend Lauren (Kathleen Lloyd) in a shocking sequence. Gathering his remaining officers, Wade concocts a plan to stop the horsepower-laden menace, but after discovering it hiding in his own garage, Wade is forced to lure the car into a mountainous canyon area. A final confrontation settles the score and reveals the driver's frightening identity.\n\n\n\nInfo: 672x288\n      MPEG Layer-3 @115kbps\n      25fps @ 1034kbps\n \n\nScreens: http://www.imagebam.com/image/15b37e23020861\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:94baf655f60c5d34f0aa572455d119959a5e1874","amp;dn":"The.Car.DVDRip.Xvid","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"94baf655f60c5d34f0aa572455d119959a5e1874","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,186,246,85,246,12,93,52,240,170,87,36,85,209,25,149,154,94,24,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
