Elysium is a comeback of sorts, not because the band has shifted away dramatically since the departure of Tolkki, but because it features track after track of music that isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t mediocre. Now, IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m sure that Stratovarius fans will be in up in arms over this statement, but Stratovarius has been known to release very mediocre albums mainly due to a lack of originality, or just creative songwriting within their framed style. Elysium represents a return to what made Stratovarius an innovator within the power metal genre, with grandiose solos and melodies, a soaring, epic vocal performance by Timo Kotipelto, and a particularly powerful opus known as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œElysium.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nIn particular, the opening two songs ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDarkest HoursÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œUnder Flaming SkiesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ are really stand out songs, the first with some really great melodies, and the second with some inclusion of groove which is completely unexpected and a welcome follow up to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDarkest Hours.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œInfernal MazeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is a song that is a combination of KamelotÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s sultry vocal style as a lead in, which delivers us to a pleasant, Stratovarious style speedy neo-classical number that doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t drag, or sound like a stagnant carbon copy of any number of the bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s other tunes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a7621e06842d39ecc7ed0b1b6a456a57136746b1","amp;dn":"Stratovarius+-+Elysium+%5BCollector+s+Edition%5D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a7621e06842d39ecc7ed0b1b6a456a57136746b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,98,30,6,132,45,57,236,199,237,11,27,106,69,106,87,19,103,70,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
