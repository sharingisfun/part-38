The Show Must Go On\n\nThe Kids from &quot;Fame&quot; was the group name of several cast members from the TV series Fame who had a number of hit singles and albums at the height of the show's success in the UK. This success culminated in tours of the UK where they performed live in concert. A live album was subsequently released.\n\nThe group came to prominence in the summer of 1982 when the series first aired in the UK and a single &quot;Hi Fidelity&quot; reached No.5.[3] Along with this an album was released: The Kids from &quot;Fame&quot;, which reached No.1 for 12 weeks.[4][5] A series of singles and albums followed over the next 12 months with songs taken from the show's first three seasons.[6] By the summer of 1983, interest in the show was beginning to wane and the releases abruptly stopped, although the TV series carried on for a number of years.\nThe main vocalists of the group were Debbie Allen, Valerie Landsburg, Erica Gimpel, Carlo Imperato, Gene Anthony Ray, Lee Curreri, Lori Singer and P.R. Paul.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Abrasax/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Abrasax/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c695fea2287ef42105adadcae3dfdcf9ea23f6c","amp;dn":"The+Kids+From+Fame+Again+-+Vinylrip+-+Abrasax","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c695fea2287ef42105adadcae3dfdcf9ea23f6c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,105,95,234,34,135,239,66,16,90,218,220,174,61,253,207,158,162,63,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
