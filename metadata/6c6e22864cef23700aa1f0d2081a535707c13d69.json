They are perhaps best remembered for their five biggest songs &quot;My Girl (Gone Gone Gone)&quot;, &quot;I Believe&quot;, &quot;Whatcha Gonna Do&quot;, &quot;Fly At Night&quot; and &quot;Lonesome Mary&quot;. The band's lineup has changed numerous times, though Bill Henderson has constantly remained a fixture, and Chilliwack continue to tour across Canada.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDreams, Dreams, Dreams is the sixth album by the Canadian rock band Chilliwack. After Chilliwack's failure to find an audience with Rockerbox, this album (with the same lineup) marked the band's return to the top 10 in Canada with &quot;Fly at Night&quot;, while &quot;California Girl&quot; and &quot;Baby Blue&quot; were also Top 40 hits there. &quot;Rain-O&quot; was a remake of Chilliwack's first hit.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBill Henderson: guitar, vocals, solina\nGlenn Miller: bass, vocals\nRoss Turney: drums, percussion\nHoward Froese: guitar, vocals, solina, piano\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c6e22864cef23700aa1f0d2081a535707c13d69","amp;dn":"Chilliwack+-+Dreams%2C+Dreams%2C+Dreams+%5B1977%5D%5B2013%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c6e22864cef23700aa1f0d2081a535707c13d69","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,110,34,134,76,239,35,112,10,161,240,210,8,26,83,87,7,193,61,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
