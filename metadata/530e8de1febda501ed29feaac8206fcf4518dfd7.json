Dave Farrow is the  \n                    life and soul of any party. Forever in the  \n                    shadow of big brother Steven, star midfielder  \n                    for the reds, Dave only gets noticed for the  \n                    wrong reasons, and seems to be spiralling out  \n                    of control. Dave is adamant there is no  \n                    problem; he just likes a beer with the lads.  \n                    A&amp;E nurse Ruth sees something in him, but  \n                    whether Dave will be able to put aside his  \n                    demons for long enough to give their     \n                    relationship a chance is another matter. Will  \n                    Steven and Ruth be able to help Dave before he  \n                    presses the self-destruct button - or will he  \n                    take them down with him?                 \n                                                         \n                                                                                                \n                                                      \n                                       \n                                                \n                                        \n                                         \n                                                \n                                                                     \n                          RiPPERS NOTES:                           \n                                                                      \n\n                     \n                        Enjoy this great release from BiA\n\n                                                      \n                                       \n                                                \n                                        \n                                         \n                                                \n                                                                     \n                           GROUP NOTES:                            \n                                                                      \n\n                                   Greetz to \n\n                            FoV SFM TBS XiSO SAiNTS\n\n                            love your work boys ;)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:530e8de1febda501ed29feaac8206fcf4518dfd7","amp;dn":"Moving.On.S02E09.720p.HDTV.x264-BiA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"530e8de1febda501ed29feaac8206fcf4518dfd7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,14,141,225,254,189,165,1,237,41,254,170,200,32,111,207,69,24,223,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
