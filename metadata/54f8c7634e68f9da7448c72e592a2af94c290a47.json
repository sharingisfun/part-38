Light, breezy, and effortless, the suitably titled Perfect Day is languid without being sleepy, and clever enough to appease fans of the husky-voiced croonerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s earlier, edgier material. Bolstered by stand-out, radio-ready cuts like Ã¢â‚¬Å“Honeypot,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Everything You Love,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Penelope Cruz,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Perfect Day is less infused with the shades of folk-funk and mambo-infused pop/rock that peppered earlier releases like IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m Good Now and Lovely Creatures, and more concerned with watching the sun go down in the rear view mirror. Is it earth shattering stuff? Not really, but the Ypsilanti, Michigan native has crafted a perfect little siesta of a record that, like old friends, never wears out its welcome, and leaves a lasting weekend glow that makes the daily grind a little more tolerable.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:54f8c7634e68f9da7448c72e592a2af94c290a47","amp;dn":"Bob+Schneider+-+A+Perfect+Day+%5B2011%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"54f8c7634e68f9da7448c72e592a2af94c290a47","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,248,199,99,78,104,249,218,116,72,199,46,89,42,42,249,76,41,10,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
