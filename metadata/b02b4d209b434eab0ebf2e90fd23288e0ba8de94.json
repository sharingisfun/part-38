Now the acclaimed author of The Book of Joe and Everything Changes tackles love, lust, and lost in the suburbsÃ¢â‚¬â€in a stunning novel that is by turns heartfelt and riotously funny.\n\nDoug Parker is a widower at age twenty-nine, and in his quiet suburban town, that makes him something of a celebrityÃ¢â‚¬â€the object of sympathy, curiosity, and, in some cases, unbridled desire. But Doug has other things on his mind. First there's his sixteen year-old stepson, Russ: a once-sweet kid who now is getting into increasingly serious trouble on a daily basis. Then there are Doug's sisters: his bossy twin, Clair, who's just left her husband and moved in with Doug, determined to rouse him from his grieving stupor. And Debbie, who's engaged to Doug's ex-best friend and manically determined to pull off the perfect wedding at any cost.\n\nSoon Doug's entire nuclear family is in his face. And when he starts dipping his toes into the shark-infested waters of the second-time-around dating scene, it isn't long before his new life is spinning hopelessly out of control, cutting a harrowing and often hilarious swath of sexual missteps and escalating chaos across the suburban landscape.\n\n                              Format 1 - .ePUB\n\n                              Format 2 - .Mobi\n\n                          Published - July 17th 2007\n\n                All my Ebook uploads are separated by Genre Tags \n\n \n            **Support Your Favorite Authors By Buying Their Books**\n\n\n                Check out all my Magazine and ebook uploads here.\n\n                    &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b02b4d209b434eab0ebf2e90fd23288e0ba8de94","amp;dn":"How+to+Talk+to+a+Widower+by+Jonathan+Tropper+%28ePUB%2FMobi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b02b4d209b434eab0ebf2e90fd23288e0ba8de94","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,43,77,32,155,67,78,171,14,191,46,144,253,35,40,142,11,168,222,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
