Author Underwood Dudley, who has written a series of popular mathematics books, maintains that the best way to learn mathematics is by solving problems. In keeping with this philosophy, the text includes nearly 1,000 exercises and problems - some computational and some classical, many original, and some with complete solutions. \n\nThe opening chapters offer sound explanations of the basics of elementary number theory and develop the fundamental properties of integers and congruences. Subsequent chapters present proofs of Fermat's and Wilson's theorems, introduce number theoretic functions, and explore the quadratic reciprocity theorem. Three independent sections follow, with examinations of the representation of numbers, diophantine equations, and primes. The text concludes with 260 additional problems, three helpful appendixes, and answers to selected exercises and problems. \n\nContents\n========\n\n  Preface\n   1. Integers\n   2.

His unique and wonderful book Mathematical Cranks (The Mathematics Association of America, 1992) is a readable feast, especially for those who have been on the receiving end of mathematical crank mail. We're all in Woody's debt for having assembled this collection of failed squared circles, angle trisections, and much, much more.\n\nHowever, chronicling the cranks -- as enjoyable as it may have been to the rest of us -- is hardly a career, Woody has written many other books as well. And any reader who wants to check out a totally uncranky, reader- and student-friendly, time-tested basic text in Elementary Number Theory could hardly do better than to look at the Dover edition of Woody's book by that name, which started its career with Freeman in 1969 and which Dover was pleased to reprint in 2008.\n\n-_-\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8af1d4795ef61343ac841e4f10d7fd83d561629c","amp;dn":"Underwood+Dudley%3A+Elementary+Number+Theory+%282e%29.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8af1d4795ef61343ac841e4f10d7fd83d561629c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,241,212,121,94,246,19,67,172,132,30,79,16,215,253,131,213,97,98,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
