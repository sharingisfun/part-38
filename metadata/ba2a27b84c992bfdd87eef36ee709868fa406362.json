The storyline followed immediately from the preceding Vol 2 (which was under the header &quot;Heroes Reborn&quot;). This volume starts off under the banner &quot;Heroes Return&quot;, and is notable for two of the best creator runs in the character's history, those of Mark Waid and Dan Jurgens. Waid wrote issues 01-23 + an annual and Jurgens wrote issues 25-50 (with Tom DeFalco doing #24). Cap had to deal with his own mortality, new friends and enemies, OLD allies and the Red Skull, and many other dramatic situations. All in all, this is great work, and worth exploring. \n\nI have divided this torrent into 10 sections, 9 of which roughly approximate the collected editions of this series (with one exception, a multi-title crossover in it's own folder). The last part is all of the annuals except the 2000 version, which is included in an earlier folder as a piece of a larger story. Everything is in reading order and clearly labeled with the additional issues delineated by letter (i.e. &quot;a,b,c&quot;); the contents are:\n\n01 To Serve And Protect (CA 01-07)\n02 Live Kree Or Die! (IIM 07, CA 08, Qu 10, Av 07)\n03 American Nightmare (CA 09-13)\n04 Red Glare (CA 14-19)\n05 Land Of The Free (CA 20-24)\n06 CA by Jurgens, Vol 1 (CA 25-34)\n07 CA by Jurgens, Vol 2 (CA 35-44 + 2000 Ann)\n08 CA by Jurgens, Vol 3 (CA 45-50)\n09 Dead Men Running (CA - DMR 01-03) - This miniseries helps close out the volume.\n10 Bonus: Annuals - This has the two 1998 Annuals (one with Iron Man and the other with Citizen V) and the 1999 + 2001 editions as well.\n\nAs to sourcing, unfortunately it is all over the place, but one of the reasons I made this compilation is because over half is available in Digital form. Issues 01-24 + the 1998 (a) and 1999 Annual are by Digital-Empire. 25-30 are Digital by Colecionadores-Go. 31-34 are HQ TPB scans by Bchry-DCP. The rest (included the issues of QUicksilver, Invincible Iron Man and The Avengers in &quot;Live Kree Or Die!&quot;) are low-res c2c or noads scans by either DCP or Ouroboros. Thanks to ALL the scanner groups for their hard work - I hope you enjoy this collection, and please seed, enjoy! :-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba2a27b84c992bfdd87eef36ee709868fa406362","amp;dn":"Captain+America+v3+01-50+%2B+Ex+%281998-2002%7CDigital%2BS%7CEmpire%2BDCP%2B%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba2a27b84c992bfdd87eef36ee709868fa406362","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,42,39,184,76,153,43,253,216,126,239,54,238,112,152,104,250,64,99,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
