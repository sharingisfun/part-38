The alphabetically-arranged articles often criticize the Roman Catholic Church and other institutions. The first edition, released in June of 1764, went by the name of Dictionnaire Philosphique Portatif. It was 344 pages and consisted of 73 articles. Later versions were expanded into two volumes consisting of 120 articles.[1] The first editions were published anonymously in Geneva by Gabriel Grasset. Due to the volatile content of the Dictionnaire, Voltaire chose Grasset over his usual publisher to ensure his own anonymity.[2] The Dictionnaire was a lifelong project for Voltaire. It represents the culmination of his views on Christianity, God, morality, and other subjects.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa41bed7c319e32a2f117b68a86a92bd2ae590fd","amp;dn":"Ebook+-+Voltaires+Philosophical+Dictionary+by+Voltaire","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa41bed7c319e32a2f117b68a86a92bd2ae590fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,65,190,215,195,25,227,42,47,17,123,104,168,106,146,189,42,229,144,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
