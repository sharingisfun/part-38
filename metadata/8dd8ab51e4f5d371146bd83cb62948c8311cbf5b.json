But the Thorsen destiny leads them all to where the family's history began -- through secret portals into a place of legend and peril. For here, where the blade of Torrie's father once loyally served the House of the Sky, son and father both must suffer for ancient transgressions. And with war clouds gathering above the Middle Dominion, an unlikely champion will raise his sword in defense of captive friends . . . to prevent the fiery coming of the End of All Days.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8dd8ab51e4f5d371146bd83cb62948c8311cbf5b","amp;dn":"The+Fire+Duke+%28Keepers+of+the+Hidden+Ways%2C+%231%29+-+Joel+Rosenberg","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8dd8ab51e4f5d371146bd83cb62948c8311cbf5b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,216,171,81,228,245,211,113,20,107,216,60,182,41,72,200,49,28,191,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
