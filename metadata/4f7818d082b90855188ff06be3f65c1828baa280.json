If the Terminator succeeds, mankind is doomed. Sarah's only hope is a soldier from that post-apocalyptic war, who has chased the Terminator back through time. The future of the human race depends on which one finds her first...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f7818d082b90855188ff06be3f65c1828baa280","amp;dn":"THE+TERMINATOR.1984.PAL.Multisubs.DVDr.ISO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f7818d082b90855188ff06be3f65c1828baa280","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,120,24,208,130,185,8,85,24,143,240,107,227,246,92,24,40,186,162,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
