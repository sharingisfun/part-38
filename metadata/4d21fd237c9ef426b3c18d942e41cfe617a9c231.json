Lott enlisted previous collaborators Mads Hauge, Phil Thornalley, Toby Gad, Steve Kipner and Andrew Frampton to handle production for the album, in addition to new collaborators such as Tim Powell, The Matrix and Rusko. The album also includes collaborations with artists such as Stevie Wonder and John Legend.  Upon its release, Young Foolish Happy was met with mixed reviews from music critics; while some reviewers found the album solid, others viewed it as formulaic and short of originality, and felt it lacks the &quot;charm&quot; of Lott's debut album, Turn It Up (2009). The album debuted at number eighteen on the UK Albums Chart with first-week sales of 18,503 copies, failing to match the commercial success of its predecessor. It spawned the UK number-one single &quot;All About Tonight&quot; and the top ten singles &quot;What Do You Take Me For?&quot; and &quot;Kiss the Stars&quot;.\n\n \n\nCD Track Listings\n\n[01] Come Get It Now\n[02] All About Tonight\n[03] What Do You Take Me For - - - Pixie Lott Featuring Pusha T\n[04] Nobody Does It Better\n[05] Kiss The Stars\n[06] Stevie On The Radio\n[07] Everybody Hurts Sometimes\n[08] Dancing On My Own - - - Pixie Lott Featuring Marty James\n[09] Love You To Death\n[10] Birthday\n[11] Bright Lights (Good Times) Part II - - - Pixie Lott Featuring Tinchy Stryder\n[12] Perfect\n[13] You Win\n[14] We Just Go On\n\nPlay Time - 00h:49m:20s\n\nTotal File Size....................... 348mb (Including FLAC + Logs, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat / Info.......................
