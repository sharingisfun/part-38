When a new home can be found for them, they are lovingly and painstakingly rebuilt. These are not grand buildings, but everyday buildings that give an extraordinary insight into the lives of the people who lived and worked in them. Deep within their fabric are preserved astonishing stories about how we lived and worked.\n\n\n1)  Part 1 \nArchitectural designer Charlie Luxton explores how these vast and hugely complex jigsaw puzzles are pieced back together, trying his hand at the array of ancient crafts required. Meanwhile, architectural historian Dan Cruickshank investigates the building's history, proving that even seemingly humble buildings have incredible stories to tell. In this episode Dan and Charlie follow the reconstruction of one of Britain's earliest aviation buildings: Claude Grahame-White's watchtower. Graham-White was a heroic pioneer of early aviation and his watchtower was the nerve centre of the vast aircraft factory he built to supply warplanes for World War I.\n\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img850.imageshack.us/img850/6431/brickbybrickrebuildingo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img850.imageshack.us/img850/6431/brickbybrickrebuildingo.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img827.imageshack.us/img827/6431/brickbybrickrebuildingo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img827.imageshack.us/img827/6431/brickbybrickrebuildingo.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img40.imageshack.us/img40/6431/brickbybrickrebuildingo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img40.imageshack.us/img40/6431/brickbybrickrebuildingo.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img826.imageshack.us/img826/6431/brickbybrickrebuildingo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img826.imageshack.us/img826/6431/brickbybrickrebuildingo.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img207.imageshack.us/img207/6431/brickbybrickrebuildingo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img207.imageshack.us/img207/6431/brickbybrickrebuildingo.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img444.imageshack.us/img444/6431/brickbybrickrebuildingo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img444.imageshack.us/img444/6431/brickbybrickrebuildingo.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img220.imageshack.us/img220/6431/brickbybrickrebuildingo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img220.imageshack.us/img220/6431/brickbybrickrebuildingo.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img853.imageshack.us/img853/6431/brickbybrickrebuildingo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img853.imageshack.us/img853/6431/brickbybrickrebuildingo.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img820.imageshack.us/img820/6431/brickbybrickrebuildingo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img820.imageshack.us/img820/6431/brickbybrickrebuildingo.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1545 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 400\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.800 (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 29\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 59.Mins\n * Number Of Parts: 3\n * Part Size: 701 MB\n * Source: PDTV\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.beamish.org.uk/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.beamish.org.uk/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.rafmuseum.org.uk/london/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.rafmuseum.org.uk/london/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43076327827c739f184ba704ac54f8f382020207","amp;dn":"BBC+Brick+by+Brick+Rebuilding+Our+Past+1of3+PDTV+XviD+AC3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43076327827c739f184ba704ac54f8f382020207","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,7,99,39,130,124,115,159,24,75,167,4,172,84,248,243,130,2,2,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
