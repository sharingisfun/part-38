He worked side-by-side with Monet on the banks of the Seine, sharing his concern with light and colour, but landscape painting never displaced his enduring love of figure painting. A natural heir to the delicacy of Boucher, Watteau and Fragonard, delighting in the ample curves of the nudes he painted increasingly frequently in his later years, Renoir was also a master at capturing the spirit of Parisian life. His art is filled with optimism - his lifelong philosophy was that he painted because it ave him pleasure, and he shares that pleasure with those who see his work. It is almost always summer in his pictures, and in paintings like Moulin de la Galette, The Dance at Bougival and The Luncheon of the Boating Party he gives us an enduring record of his contemporaries relaxing and enjoying their leisure.\r\n\r\nIn this expanded version of William Gaunt's illuminating essay on Renoir (first published in 1962). Kathleen Adier has added notes to the plates and a wealth of black-and-white comparative illustrations, to make this the perfect introduction to the life and work of an extraordinary artist","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a6bbf0bdda7a040bc73da5b2396aa9af89624f03","amp;dn":"Renoir+%28Phaidon+Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a6bbf0bdda7a040bc73da5b2396aa9af89624f03","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,187,240,189,218,122,4,11,199,61,165,178,57,106,169,175,137,98,79,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
