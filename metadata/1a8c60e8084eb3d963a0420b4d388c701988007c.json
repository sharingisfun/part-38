These readily reproducible methods can be used to improve enzyme function by directed evolution, to covalently immobilize enzymes, to microencapsulate enzymes and cells, and to manufacture enzymes for human health, nutrition, and environmental protection. Overview chapters on microorganisms as a source of metabolic and enzymatic diversity, and on the fast-moving field of enzyme biosensors are presented. Microbial Enzymes and Biotransformations offers laboratory and industrial scientists a wealth of proven enzymatic protocols that show clearly how to go from laboratory results to successful industrial applications","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a8c60e8084eb3d963a0420b4d388c701988007c","amp;dn":"Methods+in+Biotechnology+17+-+Microbial+Enzymes+and+Biotransform","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a8c60e8084eb3d963a0420b4d388c701988007c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,140,96,232,8,78,179,217,99,160,66,11,77,56,140,112,25,136,0,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
