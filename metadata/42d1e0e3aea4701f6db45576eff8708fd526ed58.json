By July 2004, when the epidemic was finally declared over, it had killed nearly 800 people including many healthcare workers. Although by some standards, this first emerging and readily transmissible disease of the 21st century was not a big killer, it caused more fear and social disruption than any other outbreak of our time.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:42d1e0e3aea4701f6db45576eff8708fd526ed58","amp;dn":"SARS+-+How+a+Global+Epidemic+Was+Stopped+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"42d1e0e3aea4701f6db45576eff8708fd526ed58","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,209,224,227,174,164,112,31,109,180,85,118,239,248,112,143,213,38,237,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
