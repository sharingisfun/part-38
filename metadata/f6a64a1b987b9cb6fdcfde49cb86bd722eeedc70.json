I have also included a few of the Prima Official Strategy Guides.\n\nThese Role-Playing books are fucking amazing. I don't play DnD myself, and that's not why I love these books. There are literally hundreds of pages of official artwork &amp; lore that I've always wanted but never knew existed. \n\nDon't even get me started ranting on why I never heard of these types of books until now. I would have thrown money at these guys in 2002 if I had known they were making these! \n\n\n****************************************************************************\nI am still missing ONE book from my Sword &amp; Sorcery collection!
