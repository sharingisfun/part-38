At the theater guests were given a &quot;Ghost Viewer&quot; which had blue and red cellophane strips. While the bulk of the film is black and white, the ghost scenes were tinted blue and red. When prompted on screen, the viewer was to look through the red strip in order to see the ghosts. If one were too scared, one could look through the blue strip and the ghosts would vanish.\n\nThis is a fantastically cheesy fright flick, and watching it in black and white without the Ghost Viewer kind of ruins the fun of it. There was a DVD that came with a smaller version of the Ghost Viewer, but it is sadly out of print. I couldn't find the full color Illusion-O version anywhere online, so I tracked down a copy of the DVD and ripped it for you all. If you aren't fortunate enough to have a real Ghost Viewer, you can just look through either eye of a pair of red/blue or even red/cyan anaglyph 3D glasses and it will work just fine. Happy ghost hunting!\n\n720x396 .avi, English subs included","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5628111237f56641087126583531dee6aabd6593","amp;dn":"13+Ghosts+%281960%29+Illusion-O+Color+DVDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5628111237f56641087126583531dee6aabd6593","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,40,17,18,55,245,102,65,8,113,38,88,53,49,222,230,170,189,101,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
