Although America wishes to fight, England and France are still recovering from an earlier conflict, Japan is indecisive, and Italy decides to wave a white flag.\n\nThe meeting ends without consensus, with each facing the aliens in his/her own way. However, all military actions prove useless and the white flag is ignored.\n\nReluctantly, the eight reconvene and come to the conclusion that the only way to discover the aliens' weakness is to infiltrate their mother-ship.\n\n~ adapted and translated from official site by Cranston\n\n(Good grief, TPB. Did you really make me try to upload this torrent over ten times. And make me remake the torrent file the same amount of times? Your uploading system is bloody ridiculous. I should not have to go at this for over an hour, and have the image be rejected for resize, despite it being smaller than most images I've seen on here. /RANT)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f5a1a5d67f92f87ab2412fd92205af734977922","amp;dn":"Ginmaku+Axis+Powers+Hetalia%3A+Paint+it+White+%28English+Subs%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f5a1a5d67f92f87ab2412fd92205af734977922","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,90,26,93,103,249,47,135,171,36,18,253,146,32,90,247,52,151,121,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
