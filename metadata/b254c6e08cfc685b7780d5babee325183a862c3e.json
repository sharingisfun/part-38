Ragnar meets with his King and successfully petitions him to conduct bigger and farther reaching raids. Siggy chastises Rollo for several political blunders. Athelstan learns about the festival's climax, a ritual sacrifice of both animals and men, and that he is one of the sacrifices. When it's revealed that Athelstan has not completely abandoned his faith, the Seer says his sacrifice would anger the gods. One of Ragnar's group must take his place and ultimately Lief volunteers for the honor. Lief is sacrificed and his body strung up with the other animals and men near the temple.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b254c6e08cfc685b7780d5babee325183a862c3e","amp;dn":"Vikings+S01E08+Xvid+%5BJKS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b254c6e08cfc685b7780d5babee325183a862c3e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,84,198,224,140,252,104,91,119,128,213,186,190,227,37,24,58,134,44,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
