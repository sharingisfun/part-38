ItÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s a story that begins with a robbery from a burial site in the dark heart of Europe. Its hero is an archaeologist with a taste for adventure. ThereÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s even an international police hunt, an undercover sting involving agents from two countries. At its heart is one small piece of bronze. \n\n\nIn 1999 three men came combing through this forest with metal detectors. After several hours they found themselves in a small clearing near a hilltop. Suddenly their detectors came alive. With a pickaxe they tore in to the earth. And after a brief struggle the earth gave up a treasure it had kept safe for over three thousand years. \n\nWhat these robbers didnÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½t realise was that they may have dug up one of the most significant archaeological finds of the century. For they had found an object that would change how we think about one of the most important times in all human history, the Bronze Age. The Bronze Age dawned some four and a half thousand years ago. It was a time when the trappings of true civilisation appeared. A full two and a half thousand years before the birth of Christ humankind took a giant stride forward. At least so it was around the Mediterranean. Here great architecture flourished. \n\n\n\nFile Size: 690 MB \nFormat:AVI\nVideo Length: 00:49:29\nVideo Codec:DivX5\nVideo Resolution: 720x400\nVIdeo Bitrate: 1903 kbit/s\nAudio Bitrate: 128 kbit/s\nAudio Codec: MPEG Layer -3 (AC3)\nSubtitles:(External English)\n\n\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0605179/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0605179/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nENJOY:\n\n\n\n\nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n                                                \n                                        \n\n\n\nNote: External English subtitles included.\n------------------------------------------\n\n\nThe subtitle has been adjusted and time stamped by me.
