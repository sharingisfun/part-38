A skilled frontman as well as an accomplished sideman, he writes much of his own material and has applied his acoustic, electric, and slide guitar skills to jazz- and rock-oriented bands. Born Kevin Moore in Los Angeles to parents of Southern descent, he was exposed to gospel music at a young age. At 21, Moore joined an R&amp;B band that was later hired for a tour by Papa John Creach; as a result, Moore played on three of Creach's albums. Opening for jazz and rock artists such as the Mahavishnu Orchestra, Jefferson Starship, and Loggins &amp; Messina helped further broaden Moore's horizons and musical abilities.\n\n\nTracklist\n\n1.&quot;Every Morning&quot; - 3:00\n2.&quot;Tell Everybody I Know&quot; - 3:10\n3.&quot;Love Blues&quot; - 3:02 )\n4.&quot;Victims of Comfort&quot; - 3:21 \n5.&quot;Angelina&quot; - 3:47 \n6.&quot;Anybody Seen My Girl?&quot; - 2:56\n7.&quot;She Just Wants to Dance&quot; - 3:29\n8.&quot;Am I Wrong?&quot; - 2:19\n9.&quot;Come on in My Kitchen&quot; - 4:09\n10.&quot;Dirty, Low Down and Bad&quot; - 3:08\n11.&quot;Don't Try to Explain&quot; - 3:58\n12.&quot;Kindhearted Woman Blues&quot; - 3:29 \n13.&quot;City Boy&quot; - 4:05\n\n\nPersonell:\nKebÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ MoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢: Vocals, Guitars, Harmonica &amp; Banjo\nTommy Eyre: Keyboards\nJames &quot;Hutch&quot; Hutchinson: Bass\nLaval Belle : Drums\nQuentin Dennard: Drums on &quot;Angelina&quot;\nTony Braunagel: Percussion on &quot;Come On In My Kitchen&quot;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc4605a6015ffe5bbedba25f7ba88bef02d12bf4","amp;dn":"Keb+Mo+Keb+Mo%28blues%29%28mp3%40320%29%5Brogercc%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc4605a6015ffe5bbedba25f7ba88bef02d12bf4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,70,5,166,1,95,254,91,190,219,162,95,123,168,139,239,2,209,43,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
