When he wins the fight he attempts to flee to America with the mobster's girlfriend Katrina. This plan fails and he seeks escape by joining the foreign legion. As part of the legion he tangles with abusive lieutenant Steinkampf and bonds with legionnaires Luther, Mackintosh and Rosetti. The mobster discover his whereabouts and enrolls two hitmen to finish him off. With their fort under siege and enemies within, Lefevre finds that second chances are difficult to come by in the Legion.\n\nReleased by lurking\n\nName:                   00000.MPLS\nLength:                 1:38:28.750 (h:m:s.ms)\nSize:                   21,340,956,672 bytes\nTotal Bitrate:          28.89 Mbps\n\nVIDEO: MPEG-4 AVC @ 22995 kbps / 1080p / 24 fps / 16:9 / High Profile 4.1\n \nAUDIO:\nDTS-HD Master Audio             German          2453 kbps       5.1 / 48 kHz / 2453 kbps / 16-bit (DTS Core: 5.1 / 48 kHz / 1509 kbps / 16-bit)\nDTS-HD Master Audio             English         1755 kbps       2.0 / 48 kHz / 1755 kbps / 16-bit (DTS Core: 2.0 / 48 kHz / 1509 kbps / 16-bit)\n\nI'll make BDRip 1080p and will mix 5.1 English audio (from the German track).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a7abaf18cb212b79aa9b7d569ad874cf5dd747f4","amp;dn":"Legionnaire+%281998%29+BD25+1080p+MPEG-4+AVC+DTS-HD+MA+ENG+GER","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a7abaf18cb212b79aa9b7d569ad874cf5dd747f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,171,175,24,203,33,43,121,170,155,125,86,154,216,116,207,93,215,71,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
